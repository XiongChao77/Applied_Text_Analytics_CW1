      "2. Not Amazon, but working at a Chewy warehouse was probably just as bad as Amazon.. toxic work environment, where a lot of people did not do their fair share. When a new manager came there, he started finding issues with me and then set me up to fail.  \n",
      "They hire everyone off the street and then spit them out like numbers in a system. A lot of people had and I don’t care attitude and made it hard for those who wanted to put in a lot of effort. It felt like a high school atmosphere. Management only came to you when you had “issues“\n",
      "3. I don’t think the general public understands just how big Amazon truly is. You have your product deliveries, Amazon prime video subscription, Amazon essentials, Amazon originals films, there’s Amazon web services that also has a good portion that does gov work as well, they’re getting into the space race with kuiper.

      "  - **Mistakes are not tolerated**, and repeated errors lead to quick exits, reinforcing a culture where high performance is mandatory.\n",
      "- **Employee experiences**:\n",
      "  - Many professionals, even those with long careers at companies like Microsoft, **burn out quickly at Amazon**, feeling exhausted and uninterested in future work after short tenures.\n",
      "  - While **compensation is good**, the only recognition employees often receive is through pay, with little emphasis on praise or job satisfaction.\n",

Their cunning, despicable mentality of delivering the package much, much later than expected probes that they must get their way. That price of human garbage Jeff Bazos needs more money for his swimming pool while his poor, innocent customers don’t get their package as they were so foolishly promised and his workers can barely afford a glass of water to keep them arrive.

    "3. Alternative approaches include manual hand-labeling (more accurate but time-consuming) or using pre-labeled datasets. \n",
    "4. VADER is chosen here because it is fast, effective for short informal text like YouTube comments, and requires no manual labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis based on the example above:\n",
    "    -The misclassification rate appears higher in the Positive category than in the Negative category.\n",
    "    -Some long comments with clear emotional orientation were misclassified.\n",
    "    -A small number of comments were unrelated to the target company. VADER detects sentiment only; company-level relevance must be addressed during preprocessing.\n",
    "### Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "To obtain high-quality labelled data, relying solely on VADER may not be sufficient, and manual annotation may be more effective. However, considering the current labelling accuracy and time constraints, we will use the VADER-labelled data for the next stage of model training.\n"

      "1. I don’t think the general public understands just how big Amazon truly is. You have your product deliveries, Amazon prime video subscription, Amazon essentials, Amazon originals films, there’s Amazon web services that also has a good portion that does gov work as well, they’re getting into the space race with kuiper. Amazon is massive! Very easy to understand why the culture is very cutthroat.\n",
      "2. - **Amazon's relentless pursuit of perfection**:\n",
      "  - Compared to Microsoft's earlier years, Amazon is **ruthless** in seeking perfection, focusing on driving constant improvement and achieving market dominance.\n",
      "  - Amazon has **mastered the art of asking probing questions** and requires answers, pushing for concrete outcomes without allowing business processes to develop without direction.\n",
      "- **High-pressure work environment**:\n",
      "  - Working at Amazon is not considered a long-term career for most; **employees typically last around two years** due to the intense demands.\n",
      "  - **Mistakes are not tolerated**, and repeated errors lead to quick exits, reinforcing a culture where high performance is mandatory.\n",
      "- **Employee experiences**:\n",
      "  - Many professionals, even those with long careers at companies like Microsoft, **burn out quickly at Amazon**, feeling exhausted and uninterested in future work after short tenures.\n",
      "  - While **compensation is good**, the only recognition employees often receive is through pay, with little emphasis on praise or job satisfaction.\n",
      "- **Contrast with Microsoft**:\n",
      "  - Microsoft, in contrast, offers a more **relaxed and enjoyable work environment**, with recreational facilities like **foosball tables, gaming machines, and a cricket stadium**, promoting a balanced workplace culture.\n",
      "  - This congenial atmosphere leads to a **sustainable and less exhausting experience**, differing significantly from Amazon's high-pressure approach.\n",
      "3. In the customer's stance of point of view, this business operation is magnificent. If from higher ups to base level jobs, were given more chances to make mistakes, it would affect millions of customers. One mistake there could potentially affect millions of customers and millions of dollars regarding investors. Everyone who complains still uses amazon, whether directly or indirectly. No company has done what amazon has, and because of their bar performance, the pressure of success would obviously be something never seen or endured until now.\n",
      "4. Was in the military for 6 years. Can honestly say Amazon was the worst experience of my working life. Treated with absolute 0 respect or dignity. “Strive to be the worlds best employer.” What a load of horse shit\n",

      "1. Can someone tell me if your on a quota as a aws DCEO engineer and would you recommend it as a career job at aws.\n",
      "2. I work there I got them people scared asf I’ll beat wanna they ass\n",
      "3. Is this only in Technical and Wearhouse environment or also in Sales/BDM ?\n",
      "4. Amazon is Amazon because of its work culture. Have you ever tried to run a startup? Amazon is a giant startup and you are like a founder. Perspective changes everything\n",
      "5. Never knew Sylvester Stallone worked at amazon\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------Negative--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "1. How do you guess amazon has reached to the very peak in the business world? Certainly not by hiring and keeping mediocre staff. Nobody is forced to work for or stay at amazon.\n",
      "2. Not Amazon, but working at a Chewy warehouse was probably just as bad as Amazon.. toxic work environment, where a lot of people did not do their fair share. When a new manager came there, he started finding issues with me and then set me up to fail.  \n",
      "They hire everyone off the street and then spit them out like numbers in a system. A lot of people had and I don’t care attitude and made it hard for those who wanted to put in a lot of effort. It felt like a high school atmosphere. Management only came to you when you had “issues“\n",
      "3. Amazon is a terrible, bureaucratic place to work.\n",
      "4. I work for Amazon Books. Ruthless standards. Love coaching plans and pips\n",
      "5. I'm 51, been working since I was 15. The worst company and treatment that I've ever worked for\n"
