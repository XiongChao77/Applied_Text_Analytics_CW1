PE2wHqiwTf0,"The most gangster thing I've herd all year... ""when do you show up to work?"" 
""Idk could be 10 mins late, could be 10hrs late whatever"" 😂 absolutely ridiculous.... I would just make work so terrible that she would have to quit just so I wouldnt have to pay her unemployment",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,I feel bad for her coworkers who are probably great workers and get in shit for something small but this ho3 can walk in hours late and they do nothing,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,Women are wired differently than men we need our alone time off work it’s within our nature we are so connected to nature and super natural energies that it’s incredibly hard to follow the same routine’s physically that a man does it’s okay and I like that she values that and is confident,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,I think it's news to Amazon that she's an employee of theirs. No way their automatic system didn't boot her after more than one day of that.,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,Beo I swear women get so much leniency on jobs you should see it in Birmingham Al. I didn't know they were special until i rewatched.,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,8-1pm is a big gap. Obviously Amazon doesn’t care about quality work.,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,"From my understanding she is flex, she can work up to 40 hours, and if she is supposed to work for 40 then she can still choose to change her schedule. If she is flex she can choose time slots at any time that make 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours and so on up til 12 hours maximum in a day. If she is flex and blue badge(permanent employee) she can work in this contract for 3 years. Of course depends also on the job type, if she is slams or ambassador is much easier to get time off.",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,Amazon can be very lazy or not care. When I worked there I was negative 400 hours of UPT. I ended up quitting. They never fired me lol,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,Nope not Me bro my shift is 1:20 to 11:50,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,"I was 5 minutes late to my shift once and they almost fired me, how tf does this chick still have a job? I'd be pissed if I worked with her",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,This is typical for this generation I fired about 15 (not a joke) before I closed the position.  They will not put on a uniform or show up on time.,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,Ya....she doesnt work. She wouldnt be so high calorie if she was working,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,"I'm pretty tolerant with my team and have only ever fired one person for some pretty extreme behaviour, but honestly I'd have fired her a LONG time ago.",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,Im happy i can show up pretty much whenever i want for work. At least anytime between 2am-5am is ideal for me,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Amazon must be desperate for employees.
Maybe she is lying. Her story is hard to believe.",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,These are the types of people that expect $50/hr for a 0 skill job,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,Why not work third shift if you aren't a morning person? People like this make no sense,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,I used to work for a amazon warehouse. You can’t pay me a $100 bucks a hour to work there again.,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Once worked with a dude that was great at his job, only he was late every. Single. Day! Thankfully it was by a few minutes, the occasionally 15 at most. It's interesting how some people cannot manage their time. We all have our strong suits though.",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,"DUDE, IF I SHOWED UP FOR MY BOSS AT 1:00PM WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE AT 7:30, HE WOULD HAVE SLAPPED ME ACROSSED THE FACE, AND THEN FIRE ME!!!!",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Something's not adding up. Amazon is notorious for heavily monitoring workers' performance, she should've been fired within a month of regularly showing up late.",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,Not sure what she’s got going on but I’ve got depression bad when my wife passed away I had the same response took a year off work and even when I came back getting out of bed was hard especially in the mornings,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,She wouldn't make 2 days working for me !!,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,As long as she shows up at some point she will always have a job! They are hurting for workers~!,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,She aint gonna be working there for long if shes still there,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,8-1 pm is crazy fucking work 😂,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,Isn't Amazon like 24/7 operation? I knew too many people who work night shift for Amazon.,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,I work at Amazon and the reason she is able to do this is probably because side of UPT or unpaid time off. I’m a manager and I could give a shit less when the associates show up.,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"😮, how in the world are you still able to work there.. Shoot, I miss one shift or late by more than like 5 minutes they are on my ass about it... And I'm only working 4 days a week in 4hr shifts..... This is just proof that stupid people get rewarded all the time for doing the wrong thing 😔 SMH...",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"I personally hit the gym before work and im never late.   Also, why im not shaped like a pear",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,Well she's 600 lb and she's not like the regular Amazon workers who actually work and have to deal with heat and everything else and mistreated but it's okay she's just shows up late and it gets washed away just like several Associates you can see at every Amazon,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Yeah, it is hard for me to get up early, too... that's why I work evenings or nights 🤪",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,Can I have her job? I need the money,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Not to be that guy but 'cos of her gender, its not surprising she's not been let go. If that was a dude, they'd be gone. Like the way she smiles and being all cute about it is just disgusting 🤦🏻‍♂️ people like this shouldn't work. There's people out there willing to do anything and everything to get a job and can't and then there's people like this. Morron 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Come on. Up at 445  I work, 12hrs, 6 days a week.",Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,What? How was she not fired??,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,Hot take she would have been better off with childhood trauma and the learned defense mechanism that forces you out of bed and to work.,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,What??? How does she still have a job???,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,"She's right. I work with people that have been coming in mad late on a regular basis. 3 things that will definitely get you fired...Negative UPT, Fighting, or stealing. I haven't seen a single person get fired for being late. Real sh*t 👀🤔",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,You can show up 5 hours later and not get fired as long as you have upt to cover it,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,"I worked with a kid like this, he got away with this for a couple years, he just now finally got fired after his 1000th warning lol",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Ok ok, 10 min, 15, even 20 ok, dont do it on the regular... 1pm?! If i were her manager id show her the door at the end of the shift unless there was a very good reason",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,Wtf all the horror stories ive heard from warehouse workers how is she still there 😂,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,how is that possible without concequences? does she work later in the evenings?,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,She's definitely having sex with her boss😂,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,These the same people that are complaining about robots taking their jobs.,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"If she could just you know, admit herself but I am fat and lazy. I have no intellect. I need to work on myself. It’s not hard people just need to stop lying to themselves reflect and get better.",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Yea, i go into work at in late but never that late. Max 30 or 45mins but work in tech and am kinda the only guy on site until my coworker comes in. He comes in 1hr 30m late all the time.",Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,WTF? Im supposed to be at work from 7am to 3pm and i am clocking in at 6am every morning with approval from the company of course.,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,I would say I hate her work ethic...but screw Amazon.,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,Change your shift to second or third shift,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,"How is that rolly polly a warehouse worker?
Lazy as hell! Lol that is America's young adults!",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,Wow.. I couldn't get a job driving for them but they put up with this... just wow,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,Dude I need to work for Amazon,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,"No it's called being responsible adult, you might not have a job if Amazon somehow sees this video.",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,This makes more money than me and doesn't even get to work on time!!!,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,Bro I got fired for showing up 10-30 min late every once in a while (almost once a week) when I was younger. I felt bad and was skipping lunch or staying late when that happened. I can't comprehend showing up four hours late.,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,Crawl your far ass out of bed and go to work lol,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"she don’t seem like a person that works in a warehouse, the chafing she gets must be brazy",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,Crazy that she takes her job for granted like that.,Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,"They’ve been so merciful to her, honestly. Nice to hear, bc all I ever hear is how Amazon is terrible to work for and abuses workers.",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"She's definitely sleeping with one of the higher ups, I was late once 6 months in and got fired. I was always on target etc aswelll.",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Honestly? I 100000% understand where she’s coming from. I have always had an extremely difficult time waking up. Even when I do get out of bed, it feels like my mind is awake but my body is asleep, and I’m dragging it behind me. This sensation lasts for HOURS, and interestingly, usually doesn’t resolve until around 12-1pm. 

When I was a kid it was so bad that the family trained our VERY large german shepherd to wake me up in the morning by literally jumping on me until I got out of bed. 

I’ve never understood why i’m like this. No one has any answers. It has made my entire work life a living hell, and has limited my life in general. It sucks. She’s not “slacking,” something is wrong.",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"8 to like 8:15 I could genuinely understand. During the winter when the sun doesn't come up until after you're supposed to already be at work does make getting up feel extra brutal on the body.... But 1 PM?????? That is truly insane she is consistently that late without being fired.

It makes me think that replacing people isn't nearly as easy as large corporations make it out to be. I don't know how you can miss over half a day's work regularly and not get fired.",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,This work force is garbage today,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Holy crap, woman! Get a night job and get your shit together.",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Amazon watched this video and fired her. And no shes been slacking her whole life , big baluga",Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,These obease liberals are never going to actually work.,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,"fancy ""word associate"" your in the call center , you contact people.. your a Call center worker.  I wish these companies would stop making the titles Fancy for standard job.",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,Give her a blue caller job,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,Impossible she had that job for 3 year's! Unless she's slobbing big bob's pickle...,Neutral
PE2wHqiwTf0,"Lol amazon jsut needs bodies it does not matter, if u can lift and breath you have a job!",Positive
PE2wHqiwTf0,Ive had jobs like this its hard to get fired cause dont no one stick around,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,What a useless piece of work.,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,She has to be an anchor at her job 😅 if she go's the business would slowly fail after,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,I hate these kind of losers they’re taking time from people who actually need help. She doesn’t need help with money. She needs help with not being stupid if she worked with me her lazy ass would be gone in a matter of two days.,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,She said early afnd then 7:30 like shit thats sleeping in for me i work at a produce market/warehouse and we start at 1 am that nothing lol,Negative
PE2wHqiwTf0,"That range of times is wild lol. There has to be some shit in the background keeping her there, like keeping her on the job is the condition for some favor her boss got.",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,"9:35 What’s interesting about Mrwhosetheboss’s two videos about Amazon is that he also has a video about TEMU, but this time it feels more like an advertorial. The video is called 'I built my sister's DREAM DEN with only TEMU products.'",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,Amazon Is Garbage I’m About to Quit it,Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,"When I need something, I do not have the time or money to run around to 4 stores to find it, if its even out there since hundreds of thousands of small businesses have evaporated in the past 5 years, thanks COV and the dark efforts. Amazon requires sellers to post their items on Amazon at the lowest price of anywhere else on the internet. So going to the seller site, even if it was the same price, I'd have to pay postage. Im a senior on fixed income. If I can get the things I need at the lowest price, delivered with no cost, and no run around, that works for me. But I do get what you are saying and I have significantly decreased my spending, and I know my cash goes to JB and his fishface wife. Looking out for myself first and trying to survive right now. Great video thanks!",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,"Cancelled my Prime as well, after the US inauguration. Don’t miss it. But I will say that I used Walmart online shopping, the delivery service is a bit slower, but I usually don’t need it right away anyway. But have decided that I will now only shop locally to support my local communities. And sadly, I know Resturants are suffering right now, but as an example, I cannot fathom paying USD 25.00 just for a sub sandwich with chips, it’s mind boggling, so I eat out maybe once a month these days. Did we create this many restaurants and bars just so people would have a job?",Negative
_QgIj7eNYAM,Generally most companies have been doing this to employees in recent years.,Neutral
_QgIj7eNYAM,"With Temu prices that low, I wonder what the workers make??",Negative
_QgIj7eNYAM,"Amazon Australia has really really good working conditions, you Americans are unlucky",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,"I grew up disliking Walmart and everything it had done to small independent retailers. When Amazon came along I saw it doing the same thing on a grander scale. I've hated Amazon for twenty years, and so many people brushed me off or called me crazy for being so passionate about it. It is extremely satisfying to finally see people realizing the damage a company like Amazon has wrought in the world and to see public opinion begin to shift.",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,"You are missing stage 4. They are actively screwing their delivery service providers. So many of these delivery hubs are independently owned and ran with Amazon branding. They are run til unprofitable for the invested owners and they close the hub. Not that many years ago I could get same day delivery, sometimes within an hour or two. It was mind blowing, and it has fallen so far. Most orders are 1-1.5 weeks for delivery now and many of the items are just garbage quality. No value in the product, no value in the speed of delivery, and no incentive to revisit. Shop local, go to the small towns outside the big cities and explore your environment. Small business is still alive in America but it needs actual support from buyers.",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,"As someone who lives in an apartment and isn't always home, Amazon is still undefeated. Quite literally every other courier will see it's an apartment and drive on by. I've watched this happen with my own eyes multiple times. Amazon is the only one that will actually deliver correctly to my apartment. If a product is available on Amazon, I buy it there no questions asked.

Maybe things are different in the US, but in Canada I will straight up not buy a product and look for an alternative if it's not available on Amazon and I have to buy it online.",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,"I HATE this. There's nothing worse than waiting days, weeks, or even months to get some GARBAGE that at best ends up going in the bin. PLEASE charge me more and give me something actually FIT FOR PURPOSE. I don't need something for $3. I need something that WORKS and won't POISON me or catch FIRE when I try to use. And I'm willing to PAY.

The problem is the price tag isn't a good indicator. There are a lot of examples where something is quite expensive and it's the same garbage they're selling on Temu (or Amazon these days).",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,I have stock in Amazon. It galls me. I am new to the game. I want to divest and shift ASAP. Bezos is a rapacious __________. Heavy on the ____________.,Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,I used to sell with Amazon and they made the fees so high we couldn't even sell a book without charging a ton. Then they would let people return just the boxes and never prove they bought our product but we still had to refund. Then the let Chinese knock offs sell anything while cracking down on small sellers to prove how we got the item. It because very unfriendly to sellers. They treat their workers like crap and now their shipping is not as good as it used to be and they put commercials on the shoes and movies even though we already pay for a subscription. They really suck!,Negative
_QgIj7eNYAM,"18:55 Please stop relying on Petstore employees to know what they are talking about. There are too many pets given improper/poor care because people rely on petstore advice, rather than doing actual research on the animal they are getting.",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,"Amazon, once appreciated, shoved Prime down my throat ripping me off for a few months, while making it tougher and tougher to get help and quit the marketing horror. Ahhh. Their marketing department made quitting SO SWEET.",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,Amazon was always shitty to me because of they way they treat their employees........,Negative
_QgIj7eNYAM,Ebay next the fees are so bad at this point it's like hell I may just take it to this or that place where they do all the work of marketing and selling it for 30% or something instead of giving Ebay 15 and still have ti do all that work,Negative
_QgIj7eNYAM,It has fallen quite a bit. I use a lot of other apps now.,Negative
_QgIj7eNYAM,"Before I quit cold turkey, shopping on Amazon was a dumpster fire. I hated sifting through all the garbage knock off shiz that have these stupid names like KOLMBV or w/e.
I just shop on individual brand websites and I know exactly what I'm getting. I look forward to watching Amazon marketplace burn to the ground one day. Though I worry it will be replaced by something terrible like temu 😅",Negative
_QgIj7eNYAM,"The problem is that retail has declined to the point where I can no longer NOT buy from Amazon. I don't know how you've managed to step away from the thing. 
As an example, work specifies a blank pant, and I've settled on a redkap style #PT2A for this. I've found they're reasonably hard wearing and durable and will continue to buy them. But the thing is when it comes time to replace my current pants I can't simply go to the store and buy some. Even if the theoretical store does sell that brand, and that style, also in my size, the shelf is always magically empty when I show up. So I can spend gas and mileage to hit every store in the city hoping the workers bothered to stock the shelves, or I can go online. Well okay, so I can go order them directly from redkap, but only for $43.49 a pair at full list, and pay $8 to have them shipped to me or I can go to amazon where I already have an account instead. There the same pants are currently listed at $41.99, so already cheaper, but they're also on sale at the moment for 31.14, I can have them tomorrow, and delivered at no additional cost.",Negative
_QgIj7eNYAM,"I've cut way back on using Amazon because of them using the USPS for shipping.  I get home delivery from prime, FedEx and UPS, but not the post office.  I live too far from the post office and it is too expensive to drive for an item I paid a few dollars for.",Negative
_QgIj7eNYAM,"Enshittification is a logical evolution of Capitalism. All in order to squeeze every last cent from consumers, not paying workers fairly, all so C Suite can get another mega yacht they don't need",Neutral
_QgIj7eNYAM,"I agree in general….However I just recently ordered some specific felt. I found what I needed offered by a shop in Los Angeles. It was $30 a yard. Already expensive they ten had a shipping and handling fee that had me tapping out. I resumed my search and I ended up finding the exact same thing, offered by the same company in Amazon for the same price without any shipping or handling. Sometimes it appears smaller businesses are competing against themselves while letting Bezos take a cut….its super frustrating as a consumer but ultimately I need to do what works best for my bottom line. I hope we see a reset in the consumer model.",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,"As someone who sells imported goods on the platform...Amazon has 100% done this to themselves.  It was years ago already that they started to undercut all of us US based sellers by working WITH Chinese manufacturers directly and helping them gain access to the platform, taught them how to make effective listings, sell on the platform, and undercut all of us.  They essentially taught Chinese manufacturers all the ins and outs of how to sell directly to Americans, how to appeal to them, how to market to them, how to provide customer service for them....and then thought for some reason that China wouldn't eventually just create their own platform someday and undercut THEM.  Amazon fees for sellers are OUT OF CONTROL the last 4-5 years...so if you can cut out all of those fees...yeah...you're going to be able to MASSIVELY undercut Amazon prices.",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,I was shopping at stores all the time. But all the youngins were doing online. Isn’t this great? So all my stores closed down. All of them. That was bad for me worse for you guys. Now you are stuck with cheap garbage or expensive retailers with no real competition. I didn’t vote for this. Capitalism works if you let it. Farmers markets are not the answer. They still force you to go to 3 more stores to get your staples. Green organic stores are better. But farmers markets. Not so much for heavy duty food shoppers. Also they have limited offerings and no competitive while you shop. If you need it and you go to them you have to get it without really knowing if it’s fresh or well priced.,Neutral
_QgIj7eNYAM,"socialist here, thanks for the commentary on our material conditions. this is really helpful info. if there is a local PSL chapter near you, see if you’re interested. there are worker unions organizing around this for a general strike. this is useful info for us all to know. thank you for your contribution!",Positive
_QgIj7eNYAM,For a long time I would write paid reviews for Amazon products for a third party company. I’d buy the thing and send them a picture on my 5 star review and they’d reimburse my the full cost. Maybe it’s just the company I worked for but the work has kinda dried up over the last few years. I’m pretty sure it’s because you can pretty much just pay Amazon directly to be the top search result now.,Positive
1QUy3_Uofoo,"I don’t see any issue other than low pay. As a ups driver we got all these issues. It’s a job dude, nothing is perfect. No driving company is gonna hold your hand every step of the way, you gotta figure out how to make it work. 

Late starts wasted time?? Aren’t you payed by the hour, there is no such thing as wasted time on an hourly job. We start late all the time at ups. 

Extra packages just deliver them. Your payed by the hour right so more money. We get misloads all the time at ups.

Unpredicatable days??? Have you been with that dsp for 5 years or something? Why do you demand only 1 route for a job to be ok? Just go out and do whatever route and get payed. I was driving with ups for 3 years before I got my own route. 

It’s a delivery company bro. Routes shift and things change everyday. If you want to do the same thing everyday go get an office job filing paperwork or something. Doing new stuff is what makes being a delivery driver exciting. Seeing new places is fun. 

Honestly it just sounds like you complain a lot brotha. But maybe delivery driving just isn’t for you. Good luck out there",Positive
1QUy3_Uofoo,A lot of what you’re talking about is general job stuff in general to be honest and some stuff you just gotta deal with after listening to the whole video to be honest it is a little soft. It’s on the spectrum of soft for sure.,Positive
1QUy3_Uofoo,Sounds like Amazon is the issue and not the worker… the fact that they tell us to watch this before getting hired is super sorry why don’t they just fix themselves? If anybody from the company watch this video they know it’s not the workers fault. It’s dumb ass Amazon’s billion dollar company ass fault,Negative
1QUy3_Uofoo,"I’m on day 4 working at this DSP and I hate this shit I want to quit already, just waiting on this new job that starts next month! Need the money in the meantime. But yeah poorly managed and they expected me to know everything only after 1 nursery route 🤦🏻‍♂️ And 90% of the workers don’t even speak English so they had some guy train me in Spanish lol 🤡",Positive
1QUy3_Uofoo,"Im about to try the amazon flex shit. their doing to me what they did to your buddy, they bitch about u getting rescued even when your quite literally ahead of schedule, i almost feel like they pick and choose about who their going to send home and cut hours. such fucking bullshit. Fucking ScamAzon. haven't even been there 2 months.",Negative
1QUy3_Uofoo,By far the worse job I ever had 😂,Negative
1QUy3_Uofoo,Dude FACTS.  I've been with my DSP a little over a month and I'm struggling hard. Not so much with the job it's cake.  I know it's peak time but how are they going to give me 22 totes and 42 large overflow boxes to put in a Ford transit??? All the do is insure I'll be swept and rescued. I'm just going to do what I can and screw it if it all doesn't get delivered. 418 packages in 8 hours? Estan locos.,Positive
1QUy3_Uofoo,"The whole amazon delivery model is Crap. And, I worked for ups out of high school in 1987, and I'm a 28 year fedex express driver (they shut our express station down in Sept 2025). I was a swing driver for 19 years at fdx, then took my own out of town rt. The people in the comments who say ""man up, or you're lazy, etc"" must be looking at the delivery world with rose colored glasses. fedex, ups, amazon, usps, all have different models. Don't knock it till you try it.",Negative
1QUy3_Uofoo,"I hear a lot of excuses for not working, I did work delivering Amazon for a couple of years starting at 55 years old, 250/350 packages a day 150/250 stops, residential, apartments with and without parcel lockers, business that close before 5 pm, upstairs with no elevator, aggressive dogs, faulty equipment, faulty vans, faulty gas cards, etc. 
I worked 6 days, 10 hours a day, made almost $2,000 a week with my salary and $200 bonus, DPS bought us lunch 3 times a week, I knew I couldn’t do that for a much longer time, so I saved as much as possible, and found a much better job, I always look at it as a work out, and a great money making opportunity, but is not for everyone, you can’t be lazy, you can’t expect to be a cushy job, you need to become a professional problem solver, and be able to overcome all challenges presented to you, let’s be real delivering parcels doesn’t require high education or high special skills, anyone that can get an easy job somewhere else is not going to keep working there for too long, and if you find something easier they are not going to pay you more than minimum wage. 
I always recommend that job to anyone who is not afraid of actual work and challenge yourself to be better one day at a time.",Positive
1QUy3_Uofoo,"I have driven for them for two years.  My boss and co-boss are fantastic.  I drove many different routes but spent most of my time in the deep rural areas because the nav app is hopeless ( A.R.E.= All Roads Equal ) because it sends the driver down roads that have not been used since wagons and model T's.  I memorize the itinerary, plot it on a map in my head and ignore the app.  Map, speed limits, location pins all wrong.  I dealt with it by ignoring it.  Now I have been in a van with a camera and the camera sees and knows the speed limits, road conditions, etc. but doesn't share it with the phone.  I just found this out.  The camera keeps all this info secret FROM THE DRIVER!!!!! WTF!!!  I guess everyone else who drove camera vans knew this.  I feel stupid.  I can't work like this.  The dumbest fucking thing I have ever heard of.  With the different delivering I am doing now ( large parcels ) I am going to named driveways or rich people little streets that I have never seen so I don't know where I am going.  When the speed limit isn't posted the camera knows but the phone and I don't.  I am going to quit.  I would do anything for my boss but I can''t handle this stupidity.  Keep info secret from the driver so amazon has incidents to report to their safety committee?  Include me out. My wife and I are going to stop ordering from amazon and we have at least three or four orders per week.  I am not going to encourage this shit anymore.  I apologize to all the drivers that have delivered to me.",Negative

The ONLY thing I hate is my legs, knees and feet hurting but that’s really it. We are allowed to have these camping portable toilets so we can still go no matter where we are so we don’t stress about not having a place to release no cameras are in the back of the vans/trucks and we are allowed to cover whatever we need to for privacy, they also stack us up with water and electrolytes before we pull out after loadout.

I did amazon delivery for a few months when I was in a tight spot and just needed to find a job real quick.

1QUy3_Uofoo,"I’m a delivery associate for Amazon currently about to quit because I do not feel valued for all of my hard work. Every reason you said is exactly what happened to me. I got a violation one time for getting stuck and going over 10hrs (they don’t want to pay you overtime) in the heavy pouring rain after letting the DSP know that the rain could effect my route. They brushed me off and say they do this all the time. Meanwhile in the route when I had to reverse I realized the backup camera was upside down and the other one up top that allows you to see behind didn’t work. I could only use my mirrors to see out of the van. When the van got stuck during one of the country routes in SC (generally sends me 50 minutes to an hour out to deliver in the sticks), it wouldn’t turn back on because after the rescue came we both discovered that the battery was bad AND it was low on coolant. My dispatcher M&S Transit in Charlotte, NC does not have EDV’s so we use the rams, fords, and sprinters to deliver. Often times vans are scratched up, dented, vents not working or broken, doors or technology not working in/on the van such as charging ports. Ants infest some of the vans and they send us out in all types of conditions. Hot, cold, rain, sleet, snow they do not care. I tried my hardest to adjust and I was actually performing well through the conditions for a while but I’ve gotten to the point where I am BURNED OUT with the bs. It’s something EVERY single day and it is such a time wasting job that feels like slavery, and it doesn’t even pay that good. HR are airheads too, you can’t miss a SINGLE day off work for human reasons like being sick or deaths in the family. The bereavement policy is the dumbest shit I ever heard in my life. Aunt isn’t included but mother in law is??😂😂 who’s to say other family members don’t step up in your life to take on parental roles and because of they’re lineage it doesn’t count as immediate? I honestly don’t see how some of these people have been here for over a year some people have been doing it for several. They probably need a mental health check right about now if they genuinely enjoy it. I’m so glad I came across this video because this further validates why it’s gonna be so worth the quit. They can kiss my thick ass!",Positive
1QUy3_Uofoo,I got fired for dropping an un breakable package on a porch and my driver door being open. The DSP contractor I worked for protects friends and family and fires who’s not in their circle. Others can break all kinds of rules and not get in trouble. You make a mistake and have an off day and you’re gone. I was one of the top delivery drivers there but I was new and received hate for preforming better than people that have been there for years. There’s a downtown route that everyone hates and preforms bad on. Because it’s all apartments and road closures. The owner had dispatch call me and ask me why I was 15 stops behind and it was my first time on that route and my first time in the red in my glide path. But no one else ever got questioned for doing bad on that route. Just me as the new guy.,Negative
1QUy3_Uofoo,"The whole engine off compliance is dogshit. #1 I’m almost positive you use more gas turning your engine off and 40 times in a culdasac with 20 stops. #2 they’re so on your ass about getting 25-30 stops and hour and it’s already nearly impossible having to buckle, ebrake and switch the car in gear at every freaking stop. They want you to do all these extra things but there’s no shot you can hit the numbers they want unless you do slight workarounds like me for example: I drive with the van side door open unless I’m going on a main road to another cluster of stops. I leave the van on always in between stops, I pull the ebrake and put the van in drive at the same time. I don’t do this but some of my coworkers even just keep the ebrake slightly pulled up the whole route and keep the seat belt buckled and just pull the top over them before they go.

I'd call them and ask ""Ok, what do we do now?"" ""I dunno"" was their answer, and they'd hang up. Hundreds of patients dying, screaming nurses, and I'm here like a dope with a broken UV light and haven't a clue what to do since LEGALLY we can't let anyone inhabit a contaminated room until it has been UV-lighted.

Well, I did that, then it just didn't seem right so I drove around to the launch pad. My trainer was screaming, where have you been? You're late! I told him about the screen, he says, no, don't go by that....and that seemed to be the theme for the day. Phone wasn't working right, of course they didn't want to hear it. No excused.

1QUy3_Uofoo,"I've had to load bags a few times as a driver. The way it's set up, it is basically impossible to put things in the wrong bags. So if that happens, it's because you have lazy warehouse workers. The extra packages are not their fault, if they are technically on your route. If it's in a different city, then yeah, they're stupid. Those aid# labels are very important for that, as they are bagged based on letter group. And there is another thing on there ""AX29"" for example, which means it's on route 29. It's alot of work, but not as bad as being a driver. But I still would rather be a driver. Extra packages mean they skipped a step, and is not the fault of the bag loaders. But overall being a driver is terrible. Trying to meet time constraints of near impossibility. We recently shifted from residential to country side deliveries. And making 20 stops an hour is impossible. You have neighbors that are 1mile plus apart. Or you have all businesses, which are subject to heavy traffic. And wierdos who live on busy roads where the speed limit as soon as you leave the driveway is 55mph, like who thought that was okay?",Positive

I am happy to note that most of your complaints were against dispatcher. And truth be told, neither you, nor your boss are Amazon employees. Both of you are sub contractors. So Amazon perks will not flow to you. Do not get me wrong. Amazon is a very hard company to work for. But tgey pay well. They sub contract to save money and that is where you got squeezed.

Supervisor and manager conspired and said I was a sp🕴️y
I lost my job and . The biggest problem in my city is that wherever I go I see some people, maybe tenants, trying to make me nervous. I think they're neighborhood spies. They live in the same city.  The supervisor's job is to solve problems, not to complicate problems and link them to the poor employee. Oh what a life. Luckily there is God I think that people who try to make me nervous are not neighborhood spies, but rather unethical realists who do not care about the investigation, but rather they make me tense, for example, a man comes with a face like a demon speaking near me loudly or represents that he is talking on the phone and looks at me and gets up. By rotating the phone, it is as if he is trying to photograph me, private, unethical realists, a private investigator whose mission is to investigate no, a private investigator trying to reach my phone to put programs that have problems right.
I think this seems childish that every time I write something, but this is the last edit to a comment. I want to talk about human resources, . I used to work in the most difficult place and the most dangerous place for the health of the body. And after you wanted a few days off for exams, oh hello sir, we apologize for the call, please bring your resignation and we will compensate you with a little money and compensation for your suffocating respiratory system, we do not care about it, just sign here and here and take $220 as compensation، There is no problem in conspiring to fire me from work and not fully compensate me because there is a God who holds every person accountable for what he did. The problem is getting me out of work. Oh, 1 minute later. Oh, hurry, hurry. The sp*y is escaping. 😂

I wish you covered more of the cons with this job bc there are many, instead of showing the very little to no pros that exist.",Positive
k-RcftDUUpw,"They literally should hire an entire second fleet to reduce this work flow. If there's like 40 vans being loaded with this amount of packages, then they should hire 40 more to come in, load up and take off on the same hours to take off and deliver packages, so that the amount of work to deliver packages are split. 

In fact what they should do on top of that is hire 80+ Helpers to be with the primary and secondary fleets so that the driver can focus on driving and the Helper helps to divide and deliver the work flow so that both of them are able to make the stops and deliver packages safely.

I was just hired and on my first day alone I was thankfully delivering in an area I'm familiar with but I was expecting to at least be shadowed by a mentor for a week before they set me loose. If I had a helper I could've gotten through my delivery routes easier. I know they had me on what's called a ""Nursery Route"" but I still struggled with organization and slowed pace because it's Winter there's snow and ice on dangerous roads everywhere and it's my first time driving such a long vehicle that I'm not used to backing up in, I'm not comfortable going down dead-end roads where I'm gonna have to do a U-Turn to get out, I'd rather walk a quarter a half a mile to deliver a package safely than try to navigate my way by backing out which increases a risk of an accident just purely because I'm not used to backing out of a dead-end area in such a long van. The back-up camera helps, but I'm still not familiar with how long the van is to back up safely by myself -- I would've at least appreciated having a Helper to help navigate me safely out of areas since I can't even see around obstructed corners and hitting snow piles.

Hell I got stuck on my route once because of the snow and needed to be towed out.",Positive
k-RcftDUUpw,Yeah prime day is not what makes people quit. The low wages the lack of benefits the over bearing work load the feeling of being in a dead end career. Terrible working hours. Trash ai cameras watching your every move. The list goes on.... Prime day is the least of the worry.,Negative

k-RcftDUUpw,"I did this for 3 months until i had enough and quit. They expect drivers to deliver to 190+ stops a day but what they dont tell you is they bundle locations together so those 190+ stops could actually be closer to 300 a DAY. Other delivery companies dont do this so the 190 stops you get at fedex are actually 190 stops and you can reasonably finish it. I was doing 85-160 stops a day which was almost 300 packages a day and about 150-200+ locations. If you cant do amazons 190+ stops a day they cut your hours but still expect you to come in knowing they wont let you drive ""just in case someone doesnt come in"". I drove 2 hours to get there quite a few times just to find out they didnt want me to drive and didnt tell me until i got there knowing damn well they have the routes the night before. In one of my last weeks. They had a route for me 1 day and the other 3 days they didnt and i only drove those days because someone didnt come in. The way i had to park and drive to make these deliveries was super sketchy and all the sketchy ass people i had to deal with finally pushed me over and i quit on the spot. I showed up every day and was never late. In return people made false reports about me to amazon and amazon wouldnt tell me what happened so i couldnt defend myself then they cut my hours but im still ""full time"" and get 40 hours a week but i actually got 30 or less.12 hours a day and i took home less money than my previous job because the hours per week were so low.

tFjFBGMLj_M,"I have seen terrible management at aldi's where there is 20 people waiting in line to pay for their food, and there is only one register open, that is a sad statement about the management or mismanagement of that store, all Aldi stores. When I was 19 many years ago I worked at Kmart, when it was still around, I was doing overnight stocking, there was 7 guys doing that overnight shift . then one night I came into work and the head manager of that Kmart store greeted me at the door, I saw no cars in the parking lot which I taught it was very strange. So I asked the manager of the whole store where are the rest of the workers, he told me I was it. I took about 2 minutes to evaluate the situation, so I asked him a few questions, so you want me to do all the pallets and stock everything right? Yes he answered , and I am the only one here tonight, and the doors are locked and the alarm is on correct? Yes he answered. Well I told him, have a good night, you are the head of this store, you figure it out. I quit my job that moment and walked  out the doors. I went home laughing to myself and asking myself what the hell was wrong with that guy trying to pull that $hit on me. I went home and had a good sleep. I did not like what he tried to do, to get me stuck alone in a store. What would had happened If I had a medical emergency with no one to help me? I slept good, at that point I did not like what I saw management attept to do to me, so I went to college and earned a Bachelor's degree in International Business. That way if I get any job I can throw that degree in their face. I hate to hear that team leaders or managers mistreat workers.

I can’t believe I lasted as long as I did. They write you up for everything and anything. I got injured on the job and had to take a couple of days off because of excruciating back pain. Guess what? Write up. Every call out no matter the reason is a write up. 

Working there was awful. Having a good day? Not anymore hun. Look over your shoulder. Here comes the manager with a write up because you were at 99.9% rather than 100% 

They see you suffering and in pain and tell you to work faster. I’ll never forget the sadistic smirk on my manager’s face as I was in excruciating pain and being told to work faster as a coworker who hadn’t done shit all day but stand by her and gossip stood there on their phone. 

The way they talked to us was horrible. Just last week a coworker of mine completely lost it and went off on the managers. She’s telling them about how poor their treatment of the employees is. We did so much work. They kept saying we hadn’t and proceeded to say that we had done less than what we did. What happened? They sat there smirking thinking it was amusing. Fast forward: They looked at our numbers after she told them off. Turns out we did much more than what they told us to.

My coworker fell down the stairs and got injured. Guess what? They wrote her up. She got in trouble for getting hurt!

tFjFBGMLj_M,"They give them the number of scanners that was determined would be needed when they opened the facility.   Then they hire more people than they need because so many people don’t show up for work that they over staff. A lot of times people will realize that the place is chaos and make sure that they come in because they can goof off on the clock due to lack of equipment and understaffed supervision.   Plus they don’t want to pay for the staffing that it takes to keep track of the equipment.   You need someone to hand it out at the start of the shift, record who got what, then collect it at the end of the shift.  People will still try to hide it in their locker or just leave it on a shelf or something.  Because returning it so that someone else can do their job on the next shift is asking too much of them.  They need to clock out and get home to play video games.  That means that someone has to follow up and hold people accountable for not returning the equipment.  The lean experts don’t account for that when determining staffing.  It all takes time.  You would think that people would put equipment back where they are supposed to and put batteries into chargers, but they don’t.  Their idea of thinking about the future goes out as far as about 5 minutes.   Robots have been around for a long time.     They are expensive and require painful implementations.  Companies are getting them not to replace people.  They are getting them to do jobs that people won’t do.  They don’t call off once a week.   They don’t leave early.  They don’t get lost in the bathroom for 20 minutes.   They don’t quit after a week.  They even charge their batteries when needed.",Negative

tFjFBGMLj_M,"The only real advice I have for anyone in this line of work is GO TO COLLEGE. Go to college, and you'll avoid being scammed into being legalized slave labor for the rest of your life. These brain-dead roles are for those who only have very basic job skills and no greater ambitions in life. Or ex-cons that did time in prison and are attempting to get back into the workforce. I chose to further my education after high school. Got my degree in science, and now I'm a full-time laboratory research specialist that sees more money in one day by preforming phlebotomy and conducting potentially life-saving case studies on animals, compared to what anyone in a warehouse earns in a single week moving boxes around.  So, it's pretty obvious what the greater decisions in life are when it comes to a job vs. an actual career. McDonald's isn't a ""career"" no matter how much they try to trick people into thinking it is, and neither is Amazon (unless you're the franchise owner or CEO of either). If you're a high school dropout that can barely read and write, then companies like this and many others don't have to give a rats ass about valuing you as an employee. And believe me when I say: (they don't). 
How much you get out of life depends on how much effort you put into it. So don't be lazy. Don't be a fuck-up. (Stay. In. School).
I see this issue coming up a lot with Millennials and the so-called ""gen xers"" of our workforce. And sorry, but I'm not with a hell of a lot of sympathy. A lot of them just don't want to bother with the academic work to go any further in life. And then they get all pissed off upon realizing the only types of jobs available to them are in things like warehousing. Well? What else do they expect?... 🤷‍♀️
If you enjoy warehouse work then all the power to you. I'm pointing out the people who end up in warehousing and just basically want to blame everybody else for being stuck at a job they hate. And yet you're the one that filled out the application. You're the one that went to the orientation (so you're fully aware of what you're getting yourself into). And you're the one that walked through the door and hit the amazon time clock. Nobody else put you there.. And even after working for only a few months, you'll blame management for not treating you nice by giving you a pat on the back or the golden key to the crapper for what you do. You guys even go so far as to blame customers like me that use amazon pretty regularly. And that doesn't make very much sense at all. Why should the customer be put to blame because someone hates their job at amazon? That's no different than going into a McDonald's and being treated like crap by the person at the cash register because they're unhappy with their ""McJob."" And all you did was ask for a coffee. Fair? (Not at all).
Remember, CUSTOMERS are the main reason why anyone serving in retail gets a paycheck in the first place. And that's better than nothing. If you don't like what you're doing then quit, enroll in classes and do the work necessary to get an actual career. You can walk right out the same door you walked in through at any time. You guys arn't prisoners...",Positive

tFjFBGMLj_M,I currently work at an Amazon delivery station. I have been there for 7 months and I'm already ready to run away as fast as I can. New hires come and go every week or so after just getting hired. Their stow rates are outrageous. Stowing sucks the life out of people in a ten hour shift like ever other job at a delivery station. Pick and stage at an Amazon delivery station is MURDER. Area Managers ride our tails pretty  hard about meeting quotas per Amazon Corporate orders to badger us daily to meet their quotas.,Negative

tFjFBGMLj_M,I just start working in Amazon almost 2 weeks and my first week is not bad all the ppl are super nice,Positive
tFjFBGMLj_M,"I just started.  Leadership all seems lost and clueless.  My biggest issue is that there wasn’t a member of HR in orientation (4 hrs) to answer basic questions.  The individuals I had to interact with were apparently on the “training path”. One was burned out and didn’t care to be helpful.  The other was brand new and didn’t know anything.

There is a complete lack of information at Amazon.  No one knows how anything works, or who to contact about issues.  They have a dry erase board where members can write suggestions on the board such as “add xyz food to the break room” but I don’t think suggestions are ever acted on by management

Since I’m in outbound ship dock it takes me about 5 minutes to walk to the front of the building.  Up front they have an immaculate break room full of coolers, lockers, video games, and a coffee machine.  The break room we have in the back is tiny, has a limited selection of anything, and there are definitely no games or tvs in it.  I also don’t think the sc”air conditioner works in it.  You could walk back out on the floor and be at least 10 degrees cooler.

Overall I’m not impressed.  Two days of being protected by training status and on the 3rd day they threw us to the wolves.  I honestly have a feeling they take bets and go out of their way to see who they can break and get to quit.  (Management) 

It’s also very clicky*, gossipy, and back stabbing.  Big red flag.  I don’t trust management and I damn sure don’t trust the guy working next to me.",Positive
tFjFBGMLj_M,It's funny you mentioned a lack of scanners. The only place I have ever worked that had o few scanners when dozens were needed.....Kmart.

tFjFBGMLj_M,"I like this post, highly accurate. It's frustrating to not be able to get right to work when your station isn't properly maintained or your can't find the equipment to work with. I love how they can have girls in the lunchroom to pass around free beanies or tell you to stay 3 feet away from another person but they don't have someone by the clock machines outside HR to deal with errant punches of the clock which is an everyday occurrence and understandably, no HR person wants to manage this mispunch vs. missed punch happening. The app is in this regard, laughable. 

App notifications spewing Covid stats is mere virtue signaling. If they have 14 persons report testing + one day and prior or subsequent days it's only 1 or 2 + ... That ain't got nothing to with contracting the virus at work. The messaging would be that they are overly atop the situation but yes, it's creepy when someone from a pillar whispers ""thanks for wearing your mask"" as you head for a much needed meal break. 

You wanna give me a beanie, Amazon? On MLK Day just gimme the ""I have a dream"" imprint black beanie. 

I had Covid, it's real. I causes lost money for sure. I worked a year in 2020 with Doordash, never got the virus but I did when I got home from family members who were not safe about passing it around like their aren't variants. 

After one week with Amazon, I made my peace with it, I saw positive things and I recognized things that needed to be addressed and realized I couldn't do anything about it. I will likely leave the company in one week. I made it known on their stupid little questionnaires that they had a multitude of issues and that their training was average at best. They really don't give you a fair amount of materials to feel comfy with your role(s).",Positive

I work 20-25 hours a week doing gig work . Sure it’s wear and tear on my car but I rather buy another car . You only get one body folks !!

A yr later, I literally had to write a letter to HR to transfer me to morning shift because I was being targeted for opening my mouth to complain about my work.

Whereas you'll have some workers that desperately try to organize but with micro managing and the political environment of Amazon, those people don't last and are forced to leave.

tFjFBGMLj_M,I’m a current Amazon employee been there about 6 weeks. I do the inbound stow and I have to say it sucks. It’s definitely one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had. The quota they want you to make for stow time is ridiculously high and they micromanage constantly. Your body will hurt constantly from going at 100% for the 10 hour shift. And it doesn’t leave you much time to have a life outside of work. The little time you do have you will be tired and sore. It’s definitely not worth it.,Negative
tFjFBGMLj_M,I don't think they were treating you badly. It's all part of training. You have to learn all the ins and outs of every Job and it just adds to your job experience. No job keeps you in one area because they want you to learn everything under the roof and you can do any department at a given notice just in case someone didn't show up and you can cover the area. That's a good way to move up the ladder to be a case manager floor manager Department Trainor and so on. If you know every wing underneath the roof the ins and outs for everything you can be a potential leader. It's called worker from the bottom now you here.,Negative

btw, just so i dont have to respond back to anyone. if you didn't understand this. you didn't get the point. You can start at Amazon Warehouse straight out of high school graduation with passing C- grades. People shouldn't be starting families with those wages. Plus, Amazon has a 3 year step pay program and has annual pay increase for inflation. It's as Jeff Bezos said, this job isn't supposed to be permanent. It's temporary to get a higher education/career.

in 2022 January, I started off at $18.25 + 1.50 night shift. Today, still with Amazon March 2025, I'm at $22.15 + 1.50 night shift. For those who are blue badge for 3 years right now, you get paid $23.65 + 1.50 for $25.15 total as of March 2025.

Tons of Overtime, shift swap one weekend per month and 1 weekday per week, 80 hours PTO, 8 hours Vacation(extra 40hours per year on blue badge, max 128 per year capped at 160hours), and 170+ hours UPT (you can gain more with Overtime) with max cap 80hours. You also get AT LEAST 15 days UNPAID LEAVE for a total of 90 days per calender year. 3, no questions  asked bereavement per year with 4 months apart(otherwise you need proof). Want extra 30 minutes break? you can do that with your time off options. Want to come in 2 hours late? sure, use your time wisely. How about leave 2 hours late? no problem! We also have career choice. People mainly get their education here for RME roles, mangement positions, tech field, and CDL truck driver.

or simply to build a resume and have multiple types of training in multitudes of departments and become a Problem solver role or Learning Ambassador teaching new hires, etc. or become a Safety Associate in the Safety Community.

I just avoid her completely and I think that pisses her off. Another one is timid but passive aggressive. She sent a message to come to something called the Mezz and bring my belongings. As she proceeded to scan my badge and I asked if it was for VTO. She goes, That’s why I said to bring your belongings.” with a smile.

You were very helpful to me in just getting familiar with how things work in the FC. I appreciate all of the topics that you cover. I am currently and have been dealing with a very toxic manager since December. The one I had before was awesome and he spoiled us all with his great ability to connect with each person and was a huge supporter and encourager on a daily basis. He had to leave for medical reasons and we were all heartbroken. We had another one for a short time and now this current one. She has not made any effort to connect with anyone and will not look you in the eye when you speak to her (staring at her laptop or in a different direction). She will not address any issues that are brought to her attention and pretty much dismisses any concerns or questions we have. I seriously doubt she will be there much longer because she has discouraged too many of us and the atmosphere and mood in our area are dark and gloomy. Many have left since she started. Very sad.  Being nice and respectful is not in her nature, towards the employees. She is a whole different person when she is around her peers. I look forward to getting a replacement for her.

Oh and toxic traits you missed: 
The ones that think their 'vest color' or title lets them sit around not doing shit all day. They're the same managers that will start pushing employees to speed up when we're short staffed/behind on work. If we're that far behind- pick up a box!
The ones that will pair good employees to work with the bad employees to 'balance out the work'. NO! Hold the slow workers accountable, and don't make us pick up their slack!
And... the overly social managers... the ones that will stop and socialize with 1-2 employees for about 15-30 minutes at a time. People shouldn't get paid to hang out while other people are busting their ass... those same social managers know which of their friends want VTO for the day so if you need/want to go home that day, you're in line behind their friends.",Negative

rQxPWdhoQe0,"Throughout my time in Pick (I lasted only two days), I had zero physical interaction with my manager. However, he was known to exhibit the first three toxic manager traits. 
The managers I had after moving to pack were the mostly good managers. The first of my pack managers fits number 4 of the toxic manager traits to a certain extent but for the most part was a generally good manager and did now screw around when it came to his position. 
The one that came after him initially came off as a really good manager, and at one point was one of the managers I liked the most.
Despite being soft spoken, he seemed fun to be around. But overtime he showed his true colors of the toxic manager. His toxic manager traits though are nothing like the traits mentioned in the video (excluding number 1). His traits in this case involved giving dirty looks and being rude to coworkers. This happened at random times. He's even showed signs of being passive aggressive in the form of having talked about a coworker behind their back and ultimately what he did to me that led up to my firing. The final manager I had up until I left fit all the four good traits to a T. She was more direct and seemed to be more eager, a polar opposite of the person she replaced.
As with most managers, most of the managers in my building were all guilty of toxic trait number 1, regardless of whether or not they are generally good. The roadblocks in this case even go as far as medical conditions or injuries.",Positive
rQxPWdhoQe0,"Hello Nathan, I learned something very important to do in stowing when you beginning your day, after you return from your 1st and 2nd break. As soon as you sign into your station scan an item no matter if a pod has not arrived. Your time  begins as soon as you clock in when you get to the wearhouse and as soon as you finish with your first break. And I know this is true because I reviewed an entire day with my manager from beginning to end. They know if I'm working or not every minute you are on the clock; every minute!
As you know we have a second break of 30 minutes where you don't have to clock out. One day I had no work before my break. In the system it showed that I had taken a 38 minute break. This reason was because the computer counts your last scan till your next scan no matter if you had nothing to stow. So in conclusion, it's man vs the computer clock at Amazon.",Positive

I've heard (not entirely sure), that generally anytime that you're not doing your assigned path is actually considered system side as TOT. This includes your breaks and if you've been positioned out to do a critical path, which is why PAs and managers make a really big deal about making sure that you're scanned in order to do that stuff. Some of this information was even available to associates (which some learning ambassadors would use for assessing performance improvement plans).

At least the way it was explained to me a while back, associates are given an allotted amount of time they can have for TOT, and anything that is flagged in the system essentially has to get reviewed by a manager or signed off on.

I later missed that boss. His name was Griffin which i attribute now to “griffen’door”   

I don't like who i am and I wish i had skills in handling things differently.   Im in counseling to figure out.. but back then i wish i had taken into account Him as a whole rather thrn something in the moment that angered me enough to tell on him. 

This was a pervasive problem in my life.. i also see that i wasnt approachable when i was in a power seat.. which is likely the karma that came around.

I recently experienced a toxic Boss getting fired.  Everybody that's been working under him for more than a year already saw it from a mile away.  The problem is often that the Toxic Boss will think too highly of him or herself whilst brushing off the Team's need.

That being said, I did a lot of what this guy is saying without even thinking too hard about it because it's just a normal part of my personality.  I never base my worth or value on what another person thinks.  Only what I think of myself.",Positive

I told her I valued our friendship too much to have it ruined by butting heads in a professional/employment setting. Both her and I are slightly always aiming to overachieve....

I mean as far as I see it I get the job done just the same and if it were so fucking important then I feel like she should either clearly communicate her wishes or DO IT HERSELF!  It's taken ALLL the willpower I contrive as a mere human being not to do something I would regret or possibly go to jail for... Im sure I need to get out of this madness before it's too late.

_sr2wpO4b64,"I can't say my boss is really bad. He's very intelligent but has an issue explaining in detail what he wants out of you. I feel like I'm in a guessing game always losing. I'm a hustle type worker lady who came out of the hvac residential install as a lead so I was training guys and some of the nastiest slum areas. Not only did I have to stand my ground to fit in with nothing but guys, but I had to train them. They didn't always meet me with kindness. We always want to learn from a girl. I've never had a lead position where I'm not allowed to be a lead. When people are slacking, I give them something to do and let them know. I'm acknowledging their lack of give you know what. If it's repeated, I go to the bosses and let them know that I no longer want them working with me. I don't wanna train somebody on a job that doesn't wanna learn. I've never had any issues with bosses on that. They don't want slackers because they're being paid to actually do some work.
This boss hired me as a lead eight months later I finally realized he's been hinting to me the whole time, but he feels like I'm trying to do his job . My boss doesn't come out of the office barely ever because he's got a lot of office work and he does a lot of the blueprints for our computers and machinery to work together. The head fabricator did not want the lead position and now I know why. My boss is very picky with the looks of our work in that part. I am 100% with him. Him and I were trained by the same instructors and the union for hvac. We only about a year I think. Anyway, in the interview, I expressed my way up being a lead and the CEO no, my boss the manager I'm talking about seem to have a problem with the way I do things. Actually, the manager insisted on having me work with him and he needed me because I knew hvac. I don't know industrial curbs for commercial rooftop unit units. I do not know metal bending machinery because I did all mine by hand. I did residential not commercial. I never welded but now I've been learning for a year and doing very well. My boss always compliments on how hard I work and I'm the only one in there he can trust to actually clean the shop because everybody else will mess around and not clean. When it needs to be done, he makes sure I'm free to do it and I'm being paid so I don't care. He has me certain projects because he doesn't trust the other guys to do it correctly without smashing finger or damaging product. I see these other new guys standing there when they're not being directed to do anything. They run out of work. They literally just walk around and stand around like lost puppy dogs. When I'm done with my stuff, I run right over to all of them on their projects and ask if I can lend a hand and usually they hand me the crappy stuff they have. I get it done because believe me there's not one thing in that shop that will ever compete with what I've done in the field lol we're talking the gravy of gravy. What irks me as I went to my boss several times because he's not out there on the floor. I let him know your guys are just standing around doing nothing. Avoiding is what it is. He pretty much does not care. He's told me things like they don't piss us enough here. He's made all kinds of excuses why he hasn't taught me the stuff in the office that the CEO things he's teaching me. I'm a lead that's supposed to be in the office apparently. I'm out fabricating and I have been now going on a year. I have maybe 15 minutes worth an office work per week. This guy is such a control freak. He's not even teaching me this stuff that him and the CEO talked about. He'll flat out tell me he needs me because I can keep him organized, but then he doesn't even let me do the stuff that I'm supposed to be doing. I'm all kinds of confused. Like what I never worked anywhere that wants to pay people big bucks and not even care if they're actually working. Before I found out I wasn't supposed to be lead lol I know that's confusing cause I'm a lead. OK! Something is going on pretty goofy. I don't know if this guy is bipolar or what it is, but I can tell you something he does like to manipulate. He tells me about the compliment sandwich. I don't have a compliment sandwich. I just tell him quit fucking off and get to work. He tells me first you give a compliment and then you give them the dagger and then you go back to the compliment. Well, this guy is so brilliant most of the time but he doesn't realize he's giving me a secret and now I know when he's playing his little games on me. This is all kind of toxic, but I'm gonna ride the wave because I make really good money here. I stopped trying to be the lead, even though I'm a lead. I'm not gonna help these other guys anymore because they avoid me when I could use a hand because the boss says he doesn't care if you fuck off right so I'll just fuck off. Excuse my language, but you see where I'm going here. You start letting certain people slack and the hard workers see that stuff they're not gonna be all happy about it. Why should I bust my butt if these guys aren't and I can still get paid the same too. You wonder why the guys are always calling in sick we're not showing up and taking an extra days even predicting they're gonna be sick for extra days. Lol I say he asked for that because he's being too relaxed. I don't think you have to drill or pound on anybody who is working hard, but I do think you need to put a little pep to their step when they're not doing anything. How are we gonna teach these young guys to hustle a little bit and get up there in the world because they're not gonna do a drag in their shoes across the shop looking like they don't even wanna be there. 
Sorry, I just have to go  somewhere to vent and here I am. I don't know my generation did not tolerate not bringing your ambition to work. I can't bring it to myself just start messing around because everybody else's. I'm just talking a lot of mad right now a little bit irritated. 
I was told today I was intentionally being thrown to the wolves. Yeah he found out that's how I learned my trade. He likes to fatigue me pretty hard too, but I never see them out there even checking on the new guys. We had his head guy come try to show me right in front of him something and he blew up on the poor guy. Apparently he doesn't like grinding to fix things. See things only work when it's convenient for him is what I am finding out. He'll come and critique me up and down, but doesn't even check on the newer dude. I found out today by the trucker that one of their two by fours let loose. Nobody told the boss so I made sure to tell them. Funny none of my boards go down the road. Oh well. That's why they leave me to do that stuff. The guy is avoid it because it's hard Work in their opinion. To me hard work is claiming belly up underneath somebody's floor with the floor 1 inch away from your nose and probably 20 feet in. Somebody has to take a saw to the area. I think you are just in case there's an emergency and they need to get you out. Hopefully they don't cut you in the process because they can't see where you are. Lol but these guys think it's hard work to take a drill bit and just drill their standing in a nice cozy shop. Give me a break.",Positive

_sr2wpO4b64,"My boss doesn't like me. We were peers when I started, but shortly after I joined she was promoted and became my direct boss. She initially gave me some very confusing, conflicting feedback-essentially telling me not to review things that I understood to be a core part of my job. I sent an email out to all of my bosses this would impact, with her copied, and  listed my understanding of my role on each of my projects. This probably was my first mistake. She backtracked quickly. Since then she says feedback about me is consistently that the rest of the team finds me to be rude, which I find hard to believe. I think she doesn't like me as a person and she's in a position to push out anyone who doesn't worship her. I am one of the most experienced and oldest people on the team, I think she doesn't like that, either. I believe my time with this company is limited because I offended her at some point and she's intentionally going to make my life miserable until I leave or she can fire me.",Negative

_sr2wpO4b64,"Dealing with this right now. Best advice I have is to write down your frustrations, but DO NOT talk to your bad manager while you are angry. Instead, save your thoughts for later and bounce them off of someone less emotionally close to the situation who can help you spin all the problems you’ve identified into positive solutions. 

For instance, I was so mad at my boss last night I hardly slept. I knew I was going to get reprimanded in the morning for making a mistake when I had been set up to fail via an unreasonable workload and insufficient training. I wrote down all my angry thoughts about the root of the issue and how the company was poorly managed, but when I had calmed down a little, I shared my thoughts with my husband and asked him to help me figure out how to handle the situation without being a doormat or getting fired. His advice helped me remember that all communication is just negotiation. In other words, I had to pitch what I wanted as a solution to what my boss wanted. This way, I turned what could have been a very negative blame-game meeting with my manager into a more positive “us vs. the problem” meeting. 

The environment still sucks, and I’m still looking for another job for the sake of my physical and mental health, but this approach has helped me at least manage my manager enough to maintain a decent working relationship until I can find another job (hopefully soon 😬).",Negative

I’m a cleaner, I have a area manager and a janitor/manager who are married. 

First of neither of them speak clear English so I get in trouble every now and then because of them. They will ask me to do something, I’ll do it, days later I get a message from my area manager asking why I didn’t do it and she’ll get rude and angry saying passive aggressive stuff like ""why is it so hard for you to do what we ask"" she’ll say I did one thing but not another, something she didn’t mention to me in person. They gaslight and lie to make me look bad. 

Second I’m pretty certain the janitor has mental health issues or something going on in his life that causes him to have mood swings. One second he’s happy, next he’s in a power mood nitpicking and complaining about pointless stuff. There’s been times where he’s been in a very bad mood and takes it out on the cleaners. 

Third, they don’t listen or help when I say stuff like ""I don’t have time"" they will give me more and more jobs to do but no extra time to do it in then complain when I don’t do it. They’ll say ""find the time"" or ""that’s not our problem"" 

Fourth, they are clearly picking on me. There’s other cleaners but I’m the only one who gets moaned at about things others don’t. I have ""dirty toilets"" but I can visibly see mine are cleaner than others I’ve used elsewhere. I’ll ask other cleaners if they’ve been moaned at and they’ll say no.

_sr2wpO4b64,"Sometimes, you have no choice but to quit and where I am, it's mind blowing how many places will take a guy who lets say clearly has big issues, and put him in a position of control over others. I do know that my interactions with that guy are not even remotely the same as the interactions with the people above him. When I say him I mean 2 different managers and technically 1 woman I have encountered over the last 1.5 years. 

The woman was only a week she wasn't even a manager technically but she was certifiably ""out there"", ignorant, unpleasant, not much going on upstairs or anywhere for that matter and that wasn't just my opinion. 1 week.

The two guys had a lot in common. Extremely strikingly similar. Both were 43-55 years old. They both had a slew of issues. Really really bad marriages  and divorces. One of them told me crack was his d of choice. Not was, but is. I clarified. 5 kids, the youngest severely autistic. Ex wife had just as many issues. I cant say for sure about this guy but it seemed to me had was more of just a bad drunk as opposed to a bad manager. Always in a bad mood, picking fights over nothing. Extremely insecure over me, a single man, late 40's, no real issues in life, no kids, nothing to tie me down, good worker, the people at the top offering to get me training and higher grade licence (that is the way licence is spelled in Canada). He was insecure and with too many issues.

The other guy was exact same thing, different pile. Broken relationships, kids he couldn't afford, breeding, putting more of himself out there for future generations as if anyone needs that. Ex-Wife's gambling addictions, absolutely napoleon complex, OCD, no filter with anyone, obviously didn't have great influence in life. This guy would underestimate me too which I would would show him up every time, and he would be bothered that I showed him up. When he couldn't get rid of me legit, by setting me up to fail, which I didn't, that's when he would get sneaky. The problem wasn't my work it was that he was intimidated by me. He couldn't be unhinged with me. so they find a way.

The other interesting thing is that neither of these 2 ""men"" 43-55 held a drivers licence. For one reason or another but it is something they had in common which in this town/city, is unusual.  and both were completely OCD, in their own words and actions. The first guy I'm sure has at least one impaired charge.  As to why the other little guy with Napoleon Complex didn't hold one, who knows? He could be an ex addict who lost it that way too? Gamblers addicts and alcoholics. He says he just let it go, I'm not sure I believe that. These guys both brought their problems to work. I think that's what it came down to. It's like the lyric in that song Flagpole Sitta by Harvey Danger (which absolutely describes the second guy) ""Been around the world and found, That only stupid people are breeding, The cretins cloning and feeding"". What baffles me though is who is putting these people in a Manager Position? Sometimes, you can't just stay. Personally, I can't be around someone like these people. I'm chill. I used to get worked up, I'm chill. You blow your top, I'm chill these days, especially if I know I'm right. You go ahead and lose your mind, let everyone know you're unhinged, I'm gonna chill. I think when you get to a point where they are throwing things at you, and you are showing them up, they are loosing it over nothing and you are chill, when they can't get you legitimately they move on to more covert and underhanded methods. UNLESS you deem it not worthy of your time and presence and you move on and I don't know what it is, why does it seem like every ""manager"" in the industry I am in (not tech) seem to be broken in the head?

The associate and I were jelling while working in tandem. Communicating with each other left and right. As the closing hour comes around, we start doing what's needed to close the store. Suddenly, our Manager comes in randomly and disrupts the flow of energy and work while there is a small rush of customers. Long story short, he gets under my skin and disrupts my ability to manage my time with what needs to be done. I second-guess myself. There was no reason for him to drive thirty minutes from his home to where we work just to pick up two items that he ""needs"". I'm at the point where I don't care.",Positive

I had to work 12 hrs on saturday this week and he started yelling and belittling me again.  I stood up for myself and said i wont to tolerate being yelled at and will leave if im not treated with respect.   He backed down from thereafter.   The job i have is painful enough,  but his behavior is over the top.  He bullies people and everyone is submissive and kind to him and he justs gets more bold and worse.  Im definitely ready to leave this job even though its high paid and the economy sucks.   The mental anguish isnt worth it.",Positive

_sr2wpO4b64,"I think my boss may be genuinely unaware of his manipulation and deceptive behaviour. I haven't been able to make him see what his behaviour is. It is met with straight up denial. I'm using it to make me stronger, not be upset when people exhibit bad behaviour. What your lady boss did to make you see your bad behaviour is the answer to this question. Your lady boss was cool. I definitely don't take it personally.  Killing with kindness can inadvertently give them the in road of responding with ""so you see how  you are not doing well enough and why I have to let you go"". Maybe i all comes down to fate, they will accept the truth in their own time. Be cool, have fun. take it easy and enjoy your life.",Positive
_sr2wpO4b64,"It doesn't sound to me like you've ever really dealt with a truly toxic, narcissistic,  manipulative manager.  There is a difference between a bad manager and one who is truly evil.  These strategies do not work with a narcissistic manager who is targeting you or looking to escape accountability by throwing their employees under the bus to hide their own mismanagement.  

Take motivation on how you don't want to be?  That doesn't help your immediate situation in any way.  And if you're a decent human being to begin with,  you don't need to live with abuse from a toxic manager to know how not to act. 

Empathize with why they might be acting how they are? There are truly toxic people that act how they do in a calculating way.  For example, what about managers who are just malicious and choose to falsely accuse their employees of things in order to cover their own bad behavior?  Some managers just use their employees as disposable pawns to avoid accepting responsibility for their own actions. 

Kill them with kindness, using the examples given here?  In my experience dealing with any narcissistic individual,  this type of response is viewed by them as weakness,  and they will twist your kindness around and use it to attack you later, and will also increase their abuse because they know you're responding out of fear to try to keep the peace, which they don't care about.  

Don't take it personally?  When dealing with a manager as I've described above, it IS personal.  You are targeted,  a victim of their bullying and abuse.  And YOU pay the price through loss of your physical, mental, and emotional well-being, not to mention the eventual loss of the job and income. It is highly personal.

The only strategy here that may help is setting boundaries, but that was barely mentioned.  And when there is a mismatched power dynamic where one person is in authority over you, all it might do is buy you some time.

Your best bet is to document everything, CYA, look for a new job, and leave as soon as you can.  And if you get enough documentation about their bad behavior,  flip the table and file charges against them (but be prepared for a fight).",Negative

_sr2wpO4b64,"I'm currently working for a small business that has 2 owners. Let me prefice by saying, I'm actually not quite sure how this company is still in business. They're consistently on site working together amongst other employees. These 2 owners/bosses are always arguing with each other in front of employees, as well as the customers we're working for. Because I'm new, I'm always being demeaned in front of coworkers and the customers. I'm more qualified than the owners of the company, and several times throughout the work week, I'll bring up issues that need to be addressed, only to be told I'm inexperienced and I don't know what I'm talking about. Of course, the issues rear their head, and it becomes a giant issue that could've been fixed, but now my 2 bosses are running around like psychopaths on the work site. Instead of being acknowledged that I should've been listened to, their egos and insecurities dictate them doubling down on the demeaning, micromanaging, and disrespect towards me. On several occasions, I've been privy to customers telling my bosses that they are extremely unprofessional and should look for a different field to make a living in. In the process of them arguing with each other and micromanaging me, they also are making more mistakes than any of the other employees have time to fix.  I've worked in some pretty toxic work places over the years, but this environment is maybe top 5 most toxic work situations of all time, in history, for everyone. So, long story longer, I've tried to salvage or fix a toxic boss by using them to my advantage, and it just doesn't work. That strategy is just prolonging the inevitable. My advice is to just start your exit plan immediately like your life depends on it, and execute. Good luck out here in the work force folks, it's dog eat dog. Thanks for letting me vent  😂 ✌️.",Positive

I don’t regret Amazon because it paid me weekly. But it ruined my hair, my face, and has damaged my body. My hair used to be long but it’s breaking off.

I absolutely hate Amazon but unfortunately I'm poor and I can get good deals there plus they deliver. I have health problems now so I haven't worked in like 2 years.

5DZlA-j__5E,Combined I worked at Amazon for about a year and I can leave a thousand comments on all the nonsense you have to put up with working there.,Negative
5DZlA-j__5E,The best part about working at Amazon is after all the bull crap you have to put up with there would be money missing from our checks. It could be anywhere from 50 to $150. This was happening every week and went on for almost 2 months. Even after I stopped working there I didn't get the money. Amazon owed me almost 2 weeks wages. About 5 years down the road I got a check from them for about a fraction of what they owed me. This happened to hundreds of people. They were also big into hiring illegal aliens. All of them spoke Spanish and I got to be buddies with them. They had told me they had been working there for weeks and gotten nothing in pay but were kept being told they would eventually get their paycheck and not to quit or they would lose the job. One day we walked into work and all the illegals were gone.,Negative
5DZlA-j__5E,"The work quote is at Amazon are there because the Amazon employees hire through the company we called them blue badges, temps are green badges, when the quote is met the blue badges get a bonus at the end of the week. The temps do the majority of the work while the full-time employees get a weekly bonus",Positive
5DZlA-j__5E,"I worked at Amazon in 2008 and in 2009. It's as bad as he is saying and worse the bathroom and lunch area is on one side of the building and they would have us meeting after break on the complete opposite side of the building. You seriously had 10 minutes to heat up your food eat it use the bathroom. Only thing was there was two microwaves for 200 people to use. There was only one bathroom. We would not only get hit with mandatory overtime but they would also do mandatory time off. So you would go to work expecting to work a full shift and after a few hours they would send you home. There were weeks I would work 10 hours expecting to work 38.

Amazon monitors everything you do and say. The one time I had to go for a crap after lunch I was away from my workstation for 15 minutes. When I came out of the bathroom my manager was waiting outside for me and asked me why I was in the bathroom so long. I was legitimately taking a dump. He told me I need to take bathroom breaks either during my lunch break or my other brakes. I explained to him even with the bathroom breaks I take I still make my numbers so what does it matter how long I'm gone if I make in the quota.

And about that quota. The vast majority of Amazon employees are temps so they don't get benefits. Those quotas are there because if they're met the people actually hire through Amazon get a bonus at the end of the week. The Temps don't get any of that money. So you have a place where 90% of the workers are temps doing the work that creates a bonus and the 10% of Amazon employees get the money. That's why management is always up your butt about quotas and micromanaging everything you do",Positive

They never got back to me with a actual start date, so in the meantime I found a restaurant job making more money an hour less than a mile away. While I was at the hiring event, which there was no interview, they just wanted bodies. It was in the café. I got to see what their breaks were like. They call them off the floor like cattle, someone stood next to the door like a hall monitor timing everyone. When the time was up they yelled at the whole café to get back on the floor. They were handing them Amazon gift cards also, they had some type of leader board going. None of the people looked happy or cared about the gift cards. Dodged a bullet for sure.",Positive
5DZlA-j__5E,"I also gave your video a shot, seeing all that tattoos I am so disgusted, but I'm open minded, I don't wanna judge you, let me see what you have to say: Wow, you should just move to EU, we have labor laws here, you can even have unpaid sick leave. You can't work for more than 8 hrs per day, if you do, it is up to 2-4 hours and those hours are at least 30% more paid per hour, you have a free 30min break, which is paid and included in 8 hrs.

5DZlA-j__5E,"LOL at Amazon, if you’re late by a few minutes, or you clock out a few mins before your shift ends, you have to use your paid time because you can use that in minute increments. If you use unpaid time, then you have to use that in hour increments so if you get to work 5 mins late, you might as well not clock in for another 55 mins. Or if you want to leave early and you only have unpaid time, then you leave up to an hour early. I used to never let my unpaid time get under 3 hours. It was aggravating though because you only get 20 unpaid hours quarterly. You get paid and vacation time biweekly until i think May or June.",Positive
5DZlA-j__5E,Eventually Amazon will run out of people willing to work in their Warehouses,Positive

X67GxburFjQ,$198 🤣 I would quit that shit asap,Negative
X67GxburFjQ,"I've done warehouse work for years. I've never tried Amazon warehouse only their sortation center, but dont ever plan to try again. Its too different from the Order Selecting I do for grocery stores.

For us, shifts start at a certain time, but dont end till all the work is completed. Average day is 10 hours, but can extend all the way to 14 or so. 2- 15 min breaks, 1- 30-45 min lunch (your choice on length as long as its in the 30-45 min range) and a 3rd break if night gets too long.

On your feet all day, riding on electric pallet jacks, grabbing cases and placing them on your pallets. Wrapping the pallet and dropping it off at the door. And repeat. The most variety comes from what type of order you get assigned. 

And of course, assignments are timed. But they are pretty easy once you get effiecent, decently strong and know how to stack properly. 

Then the pay is alot better.

$20/HR base
Night premium, weekend premium, cooler or freezer premium
Production incentive if you are faster than the order time. Up to 30% of base pay.

Personally I really like warehouse work, but its not something I want to do for life. I just thought I would comment how things work in a place other than Amazon because I've always been curious why I see people constantly complain about how they run their warehouses. I always figured the getting timed thing was standard practice. Granted, this work isnt for everyone, only about 10% of a given set of trainees will actually stick around past 6 months.",Positive

Previously worked at walmart distribution warehouse, 16 hour shifts is normal, nasty managers, I was injured and they made me work the next day an never did a proper report.. the district owner gave me a choice for money under the table or to leave me alone on production forever an I was clueless and young so I said I just want to work again cause I was naive *coulda had a nice break and made real moves*. But Unloading trucks with box springs, metal racks, huge generators that weighed 300 lbs by hand, refigerators, tvs, all just by hand no conveyor belt and a truck with tvs gives low production so you had to unload 4 trucks to make production.

RTVZVv2Xnv8,"I was sent to Seattle for AD1 in August of last year, LEW in October of last year, and resigned this February. I am so thankful for the opportunity, experience in leadership, and the diverse group of people I met, but I sucked at being an Area Manager at Amazon. On top of it, there was pressure from different corners. I worked FHN in a fulfillment center and boy, it wasn't very easy for me. I don't want to go into detail because it will be a book, so I will hit the basics. A few tenured AAs think you can't say anything to them when coached.
On top of that, Ops kept piling things on our plates and grading us like school students. I hated doing KNETs and Curiosity, which were never-ending. We did Instacleans every Wednesday, which we got graded on, too. You are thrown into your role without having someone physically show you. It's business. The little things you do don't go into account. What kept me there was my team of coworkers, whom I cherish dearly. I had a knowledgeable PA, but I felt a lot of pressure from him in terms of being on the floor consistently and being involved. A lot of us worked more than 10 hours pretty much every day. Internal leaders know so much, and even though you try not to level up to them, you feel like you aren't doing much. I felt pressure around me for not doing enough or not understanding my role. I felt stupid. I am not going back.",Positive

RTVZVv2Xnv8,"I am working in amazon for 2 years, I've started my journey as team leader, later on i've passed panel for L4. From perspective my experience and also my friends I totally agree with statement that amazon it's not a good place for people who doesnt like changes. You can't get too attached to a department/process and people because in a week you might find out that you are on a different shift, department or process. Unfortunately, most managers get burnt out at the beginning by too much information, too many tools but above all by not knowing the process, which is sometimes complicated. My advice. At the beginning try to understand the process, observe a lot and don't get used to where you are haha. Everything is depending about in what site are u working at. Old site or young site? I've launched 2 sites  and of course it gives great satisfaction but it is mega tiring. As for stepping into a new role, you need to be prepared for a large number of tools, which can be overwhelming at first. As an area manager there are lots of little things that take up a lot of your time and can sometimes be frustrating. Then there are the big things like introducing new processes and departments which are also very rewarding. I would compare working at amazon to riding a rollercoaster, there are moments when it is extremely hard and tough, there are moments when it is lighter and duller, but the end result is that the work gives great satisfaction and is addictive. You need to be flexible ;) Take care for all of you guys and dont give up!",Positive

SMQ9jIypeOA,What are you talking about? Amazon cares about getting customers their items quickly.  They couldn't care less if they grind their employees into a fine powder and destroy their health.

SMQ9jIypeOA,Sounds like a shity place to work. Is there more concerned about timing people than they are about the employees. No employees should ever be time to go to the bathroom. That's why I learned to drive a forklift and I work in a real Warehouse,Positive

It’s easy, I’ve never had any pain or problems. TOT = theft of time. They are paying you and you aren’t working. From the 4th floor I can get to the bathroom and back or I typically just go on my break. This your experience but it’s not for every one and wish that narrative would stopped being pushed.",Positive
SMQ9jIypeOA,Well I guess maybe you better stay at Amazon. Because you're complaining about that kind of work you never make it out in the real world working manual labor jobs and have to think. For about the same pay you're making now would probably with no benefits,Positive

SMQ9jIypeOA,"My heart goes out to you.😢 I worked as a certified nurse's assistant, C.N.A,  for ten years and that job broke me physically and spiritually. Always short of staff.  That would force us to be responsible for 12 or maybe even 14 residents or patients who were mostly helpless. I was living paycheck to paycheck and had to endure verbal and physical abuse by these residents. Some nurses cared but most didnt.. They were only going around passing meds and writing reports. We were stuck doing all the dirty work. I'm so happy that I'm free from that job and  I'm now retired.",Positive
SMQ9jIypeOA,"Some warehouses are not as bad as he says. It’s depends on the type of warehouse and management. 
Like some warehouse’s, the pickers rate is like 65 i/h, they tell you 80. You push a cart around with a tote, and grab items out of the bins, drop item in the tote, then put the tote on the lines when full or promted. Easy job, just a lot of walking. And as long as you quality is good and rate is above 65, they’re not gonna say anything to you if you go to the bathroom for more then 8mins
This comes down to management.
Some just want their numbers looking good as long as you do your job and don’t make them look bad. Though you go over 30min of ToT during the shift, they will come say something.",Positive
SMQ9jIypeOA,"why it's bad to work at amazon. 
Amazon has a strict No fighting or harassing policy and Strict HR polices. 
1. You can't say anything offensive to anyone even if the employee is misbehaving like not working or refusing to work or refusing to help.
2. Even Managers can get fired for starting arguments or fights with regular employees even if they are being lazy. Managers can't fire employees. HR has to do the firing after an investigation and managers are only encouraged to do write ups. 
3. If someone wants to start an argument and you argue back and it leads to a fight than both of you are fired even if the other person started it. After argument lets say where you told someone to do something and they refused and you lets say you cussed them out before walking away. That person can go report you which will lead to a warning that next time you will get fired or they will fire you on the stop lets say if you threatened that employee. 
4. If someone wants to fight you at amazon, you can't fight back or use self defense. So both are you are fired. Who want's to get risk get injured just to not lose your low wage amazon job?
5. Females at amazon like reporting people to amazon especially men. If they get in arguments even if they started it and it led to a heated argument in which they got their feelings hurt. HR will take there side. You really have to cautious around woman and shouldn't even try giving them compliments because it can lead them to reporting you. 
For example male employee told lady in front to hurry up on vending machine because break is only 15 minutes and she was just standing not buying anything which led her to reporting him and than HR told him next time he is fired. 2nd example. Guy was taken to HR for greeting women with hi sweet heart with some female encouraging the other females to help her report the guy over it. 3rd Example. Area manager told lazy female employee she had to work instead of walking around. She kept refusing and argued back. He got angry and wrote her up. She decided to tell HR she was being treated unfairly and he was bullying her. HR gave manager a warning and took her side. 
6. Half of the employees are lazy at amazon esp. the sortation and delivery stations. Most of these employee's get promotions to become process assistant or area managers by doing favors for managers which involves sex.  80 percent of the lazy employee's are woman who do the easiest tasks or get some sort of promotion where they barely do work.
7. Amazon hires anyone off the streets, that includes highschoolers and bums so most are lazy and don't care if they get fired and most are temporary.",Negative

I was let go because of that! So many felonies, druggies, and pedophiles! Also I wanna note supervisor was also mad and hated me because I refuse to let his white fatass to sleep with my 11yo daughter! He kept bugging me everyday about it!",Negative
SMQ9jIypeOA,"Tier 1 and labor shared almost everywhere. It’s nice to go to a different department because using the same movements everyday can be tiresome.

SMQ9jIypeOA,"This is madness. As long as workers are putting in solid efforts, there's no reason to micromanage like this. Everyone has bad and good days at anything. I get that people should be working at work, but this is excessive to put it kindly. I'm not one to rally fully for unions either (I'd need to know everything about a union before I'd support it) but people get hurt, people pee and poop, people need rest breaks, etc. Let them work to the best of their abilities. Example: Jack doesn't have the work speed of Joe but Jack can lift more than Joe. Sally might be slower than Sandra but Sally has more accuracy. Everyone has their own attributes they are good at.

Now I work at a new Amazon warehouse where they don’t have time off task because we don’t use many machines so they can’t really time off task and a large amount of people are lazy and don’t do anything or disappear for hours and it’s like why can’t their be a good i between and it’s because of people like that they implemented time off task other places.,Positive

Well at least I’m my experience haha. Amazon is a joke, I was recently let go for using my paid time off, which is not supposed to be a punishable action, but whenever they have app problems that cause you to get attendance points that aren’t supposed to be there, they’ll just wrongfully fire you instead of fixing the problem, and then send you to the ERC to have them fix it, just for the ERC to tell you on sight HR was supposed to handle it, and when you go back they hide behind the security entrance claiming “HR is too busy”.

When every company catches onto the fact that despite such poor working conditions, consumers will continue to support the company through their labor and consumption because their need for new stuff outweighs their suffering, these companies will change their business models to the same structure.  And then guess what?  EVERYBODY will suffer.   And once that happens, it's VERY difficult to go back.  

So stop consuming from them or atleast reduce your consumption.  And stop working for them.  Stop participating.  If everyone collectively does this, these companies will lose sales revenue which will freak out their investors and the whole company will go downhill fast.

The fact is that some people are not cut out for fast work and assembly line type work. Some people just will never be able to do it. They then complain about how a company was unfair to them and had unrealistic expectations. You should have realized after a week that maybe this work isn't for you and move on to a different type of job. I am not saying that every former Amazon employee is lying. Much of the work conditions depend on the people running that particular location. There are bad managers and bosses out there. There are toxic people all over.

I work 4 10 hour grave yard shifts. Sure, I can prepare a meal at home, ya know...all that good protein we need for the thousands of calories I can burn in Just one single night. But chances of me being able to actually heat that up, in a very time checked 30 minutes, waiting in line of other folks, is almost slim to none in my facility. By the time I do get to sit, I'm scarfing it all down, in an unhealthy pace. I don't even chat on my phone or message anyone on my breaks because I'm literally just sitting there trying to decompress. 

If we are away from our station for more than 5 minutes, our TOT is beginning to calculate and we are only allowed 30 whole minutes a night, in a 600,000 square feet building. If we need water, sometimes we aren't stationed next to a close nearby water station, and thus that factors into it too. Every thing is HEAVILY calculated, watched, and configured to where it's unsafe in alot of matters. 

We've had heart attacks, heat strokes, people just passing out, on the work floors due to the work load and how FAST we have to go. This video does not realistically represent the amazon warehouse life. We do all of that, but 10 times faster. I'm a picker, and I'm forced to pick bare minimum of 425 items an hour. That is if my robotic pods are working correctly, no drives bomb out, station doesn't break down a million times, oh and...I don't leave my station. A normal employee...it's hard to hit that rate. Amazingly I have awesome managers at mine but they are honest that it's not easy to hit those numbers and it is rarely done. 

I also average 15,000 steps a night, but have hit that 30k a time or two! I've also injured myself. Twice. All due to the extremely fast work pace. Unfortunately, I also have a central nervous disease, but it's a pattern with Amazon employees. There will be a day where I won't be able to walk anymore. I spend my 3 days off in pain. Not just a little work pain, but physically debilitating unnecessary pain. Nobody should have to work like that. There are many nights I struggle and am so miserably in pain, that I've almost thought to walk out. But I can't. I have a little mouth to feed.",Negative

wk1w_U1Xmcw,As a dsp driver the expectations are unrealistic and almost impossible. I average 350-400 packages a day. Anywhere from 170-200 stops and 250-300 “locations” which is a STOP. It’s destroying my mental health and my physical health. Most of the vans are in need of repairs and are filthy. I hate it here. It’s the worst job I’ve ever had. 10-11 hour shifts daily and then wake up and do it all over again. Do not work for Amazon! It’s slave labor and just not worth it for the pay.,Negative

My duty was to prevent DPMO from getting so high helping thousands and thousands of associates with their scans much better than the learning Ambassadors did anyway. Associates always came and go I mean no investment in retention whatsoever. The amount of analytics and graphing software I was given access to and saw the managers using in the outbound operations made me do a voluntary termination. It’s almost like associates’s jobs are designed to fail not be leaders like they claim. They can hike up and control every human robot in the warehouse and there’s nothing the associates can do about it. Tier 1s really are just pawns it’s so sad and I had to quit.",Negative

Nope, my memory was getting worse, months of meetings, HR protecting Managers best interests, Doctors notes, OH looking at other avenues, and it just went to nowhere.

rq3aUwY859U,"I've been working at Amazon for about 6 months.  I'm  white trans person and as soon as I was able to at 3 months I promoted to a quality auditor, then a month after that I made Quality Lead Auditor, I've already been told once I'm comfortable in my current job I'll be promoting to a Learning Ambassador.  Then after Learning Ambassador I'll shoot for Process Assistant.   So at least at my warehouse I've found incredible upward mobility.  Everyone complains that doing the basic jobs are shit, but no one wants to ask for new opportunities.   I went into Amazon because no one in my area was hiring but I had heard the horror stories.   Truth is, if you're someone who can be on your feet 10 hours a day, move with a sense of urgency and don't try to get out of work when you are clocked in Amazon is a fine a pretty okay place to work.   I haven't heard about this 3 year thing and I know plenty of people who have been there far longer than that.  I suspect the fact that I come from the military and have been doing labor since I was a kid plays a large part in my success there.  I bug my managers near daily about learning new things as soon as I get bored of what I know.  Honestly if they just played music in the warehouse all the time I'd say it was one of the best jobs I've ever had.  I don't have anyone but an objective computer breathing down my throat and rate is really easy to make once you learn the job.  I think they could increase the required rate a little slower though, give people 3 months instead of 5 weeks to hit rate.  I do believe that $17.65 an hour that they pay at my Warehouse is undervaluing the work we do.  They also need to remove the cap on raises at 3 years.  You can get raises beyond but you have to promote to at least Process Assistant.",Positive

rq3aUwY859U,"please note that this is just for my sight and may not apply to all amazon fulfillment centers.

also, remember that: AMAZON IS ALL ABOUT SAFETY! 
This is why that's BS. plus other stories.



1: full time employees have to work two years before being able to apply for a manager position. this doesn't stop you from learning other jobs, but only a few actually give extra pay. there are multiple jobs that should pay more but they know some people can't do the same robotic job every day and will need to do something different.
    someone with a college degree can come in on day one and become a manager. even though they might have a degree that has nothing to do with leadership. also who wants to be a manager when you have to work 60+ hour weeks and sometimes 70+ during 'peak'? on salary pay meaning you don't get paid overtime. while everyone else isn't allowed to work over 60 hours or six days a week. makes you wonder. although the team leaders, (we call them PA's.) work roughly the same hours as the managers but get overtime. even though they aren't supposed to work over 60 hours.

2: at my sight they are about to make us put our phones in lockers to help mitigate phone usage while people work. this does make some sense in the case of some employees but some people have said that they have family that may need to be in contact with them through their phone for health reasons. Amazon may make an exception for these people but ultimately I doubt it. also there are thousands of people in the building at once and if there's a fire what do you think is going to happen?

(side story. my mom drove by to drop something off at work and security wouldn't even let her in to go to the bathroom.) (another time there was a fire in a compactor or some machine that's on the side of the building meaning that it's on the inside and outside. there's a rumor that they weren't even going to evacuate the whole plant. just part of it. even if it's just smoke that's a safety hazard. AND AMAZON IS ALL ABOUT SAFETY.

3: my site just decided to stop accepting doctor's excuses. (apparently it's always been an Amazon policy?) I started getting migraines during 'peak' a time where we work 55+ hours. it's good money but got stressful after a while. Peak usually lasts a month or two. possibly longer if amazon wants.

in the end Amazon has some great benefits and if you're there part time while going through college you should be okay. but don't work there full time if you can help it. unless you love what you're doing. there are hundreds of lvl1 employee's and losing one of them in the war for another buck is no skin off amazon's back. just go become an entrepreneur in a third world country or something.

30ROx6lbBVs,"I had a toxic coworker who embarrassed me. Let's call him Knox. Knox was dating my cousin, and he ended up cheating on her. I told her and she dumped Knox, who, long story short, found out it was me. He was so mad, he revealed something about me at work. I live in an apartment complex that's mostly for the elderly but allows disabled residents. I'm in because of my learning disability. Knox's grandma lives there and I ran into him and his family in the hall. Knox must've concluded I was living in a senior citizen place because of my disability, because he announced the fact at work. He yelled out, ""John lives at [Apartment Complex]. He's 29 and lives in a complex for old people because he has a disability. Isn't that sad or what?"" And then he looked at me and said, ""It's really pathetic and lame, dude."" Now, of course, my coworkers scolded him for revealing something that wasn't any of his or their business. They even reported him and he isn't working with us anymore. Still, I wonder if my coworkers _do_ think I'm Iame and pathetic. I mean, they didn't say I _wasn't_ those things. They didn't say I was _more than_ my disability. They didn't say my residential situation _wasn't_ anything to be ashamed of. They only told Knox he was being a jerk. That doesn't mean they don't secretly look down on me.

Instead of advocating for myself or going for help, documenting, or anything like that, I said nothing and I was also emotionally reactive - which made things worse. I got complained about a lot, I felt isolated, unsupported, and lonely. I felt like no one appreciated or cared about me. Most of the leadership were rude to me, most of my coworkers didn't want to be around me and they gosspied about me, etc. I even got written up after a big mistake and while I do deserve the write up for the mistake, there were several other things on there that were unfair and untrue. Saying I was ""agressive"", ""dismissive"", etc. I was deeply hurt and I luckily wrote a paper addressing it, all of the points. I also made clear which points I deserved and which I didn't, and said some things what people did to me, etc. But I made sure I wrote it in a way where I am both protecting myself and the company. My boss actually felt bad for me.. but the situation still hurt me. Before the paper, they still wanted me to listen to my teammates.

Like yes you will attract people who will be willing to work for less but those same people you attract will likely use google as a brand to get more money from other companies like amazon, willing to pay more. Therefore it benefits everyone if you pay people what they're worth. Perhaps google does take care of their employees however.",Positive

4FUu1uCxEWI,"You been there for 1 months bro. You don’t know enough to judge that “on-call” is bad. 

First off, it’s team-dependent. Some teams rarely have anything for on-call perhaps because it’s mostly research-focused or some other reason.

On-call just means you’re working on tickets during work hours and not “sprint work”. And after hours, yo have a pager and you get paged when an alarm goes off because one of your team’s app is F”ing up.  If you understand how everything works; you can fix that issue or better yet, identify the bug and patch it so it doesn’t alarm again for example.

Having software engineers as on-call is an incentive for teams to code their apps properly without bugs so it rarely fails and so it doesn’t page them in the middle of the night",Negative
4FUu1uCxEWI,"I'm science manger at Amazon,  we have been forced to fire people to meet >6%. These number was not the percentage of putting people to focus, it's the number to let people go, e.g., I need to fire at least one people out of 10 people at my team every two quarters or even one quarter if there is new instruction from ""leaders"". There is very little which I can do. We also need to rank the team members performance every month to decide who will be put to focus. When something bad happen, the senior leadership willl definitely find one lower level manage or engineer to take the blame. The culture is just so toxic.

4FUu1uCxEWI,"I work at Amazon, but not in the US. The culture here is really good barring all the issues that are occurring because of the state of the industry. The oncall in my country is only during the work day, so you're not expected to dial in to a call at 2am like a lot of other teams overseas. I agree that a lot of manual work exists, but I found success in automating a lot of it and it was one of the things that led to a promotion within about a year for me. The issue is that the only 2 big tech companies we have here are Google and Amazon, and Google will have maybe 2-3 open mid level engineering positions over the entire year, to work on managing legacy software rather than shipping new stuff.",Positive
4FUu1uCxEWI,I worked at Amazon for less than a year. They staffed my entire team with new hires led by a manager who was spread too thin and a TL who was a company veteran but yelled in meetings on multiple occasions and in my opinion didn't really give us proper technical direction.,Positive

Lyqo2uJvNO4,"😂 I currently work there, after 6 years of employment I'm still enjoying the job... It's not for everyone... You got the bs trophy🤣",Positive
Lyqo2uJvNO4,"Currently working at amazon. I work Front half night shift, Sunday - Wednesday, 6PM - 4:30AM. I lucked out- Durning training I got assigned to floor 1, that's ship dock and pack, two decent process paths- I got put into ship. Ship is great because plenty of those tasks aren't tracked at all, and the bosses down there are actually pretty chill and respectful *most* of the time. Drama is low, bathroom breaks are plenty, and you can pretty much avoid most of the hassle by being respectful, competent and not abusing the trust you get. These traits could be unique to my building- It's rather new, having only opened last year, but being in ship dock has actually been one of the more satisfying job experiences I've had. You're still just a number to them, still only getting moderately decent pay, and you still sometimes get work tracked- but you're almost never going to be fired for working too slow or having time off task if you show a baseline level of capability here. 

Me- I'm an ultra special case, I'm a dedicated Cart Builder- That means I unfold ""Go-Carts,"" these big 7~ish foot tall rectangular metal and plastic carts, with caster wheels and double dutch-style doors- each a few hundred pounds-ish and come folded up into an L shape with usually around 128 of them nested into a single trailer. All I do all day, almost every day, is put my stuff away, put on my PPE, and just build carts all day. I spend hours on end inside a trailer just spitting carts out while other workers come and take them- I'm not tracked, I'm not monitored, the cameras usually can't see me on account of the massive wall of carts I typically produce after a few minutes- It's kinda heavenly for someone who enjoys physical work and likes a little independence. Brutal on your body but the freedom is awesome since every time I clear a trailer, my bosses usually go ""Hey, nice work, why don't you take a quick five minute break"" and on a good day I can score six or so breaks- enough to rest up, get snacks, and avoid overworking myself most of the time. 

Not exactly a cushy job- but there's ways to score a tolerable amount of comfort in amazon. And it can be an amazing place to go if you need a job that will keep you more physically active- I don't even go to the gym and since working here for 4 months I've lost ten pounds and my six pack is coming back, so there's that too.

For sure though- working any of the other process paths is hell, don't do it- don't listen to anyone who says ""You know, getting cross-trained into pick/stow/sort is a great way to-"" tell them to shut up and that you want to go into pack or ship and never let them train you for anything else. They cannot FORCE you to be trained in anything you don't want to- but once you're trained, they CAN force you to go back there- so be wary. Also don't let your Unpaid time off slip below zero- idk why this is so common but it's the number one way I hear about people getting fired from ship. You get voluntary days off, just grift for those and always keep a day of time off in case of emergencies.

Primary downside? People online get to call you corpo scum and you can't argue with them about it.",Positive

Lyqo2uJvNO4,"Well, I have lupus and hemolytic anemia, but I have been working at Amazon for two years. 

I work at a delivery station. My favorite job is unloading. I also often work as a water spider, a Non-Con unloader and sorter, a stower, and diverter. But, I also do inducting, problem solving, and straightening. Of course, I do picking, traffic control, and carts. 

I enjoy the job. I am good at it. My only complaint is that job rotation wasn't done fairly. 

Since I am an efficient and fast worker, I was given harder work regularly. I like that, because it makes it seem as though my day goes by more quickly. 

However, during times when I have severe lupus flare-ups, or I am going through an anemia pain crisis, I don't want to sort Non-Cons, or go out side in below zero temperature for 3 1/2 hours, while cute, younger women get to simply stand at a table and induct or push. 

After presenting this complaint to management about five times, nothing was done about it. So finally, I threatened to quit if I wasn't put in a rotation where I occasionally got the easier jobs too (like when I am extremely sick). They realized I wasn't bluffing. Ever since then (about 2 1/2 months ago) I get to induct and do problem solved too, instead of sorting and unloading Non-Cons all day, and going outside in below zero temperatures three or four times a week.",Negative

Lyqo2uJvNO4,Let me give u guys my honest truth. It depends on your lifestyle. If u a person with kids and bills yes the job will most definitely sucks. I’m 19 and I started two weeks ago everything they said in orientation is a lie. For my situation I already knew how stressful jobs is for people who didn’t work when they were teenagers are going to get a taste. I work at little ceasers and it required more skill and was way stressful than Amazon. Amazon was easy for me yea I had to stand for ten hours overnight but like I said it depends on ur lifestyle I already use to stressful jobs and tbh I have benefits like dreads so I put my AirPods in without being notice. I do sorting which is easy ash just boring. Bathroom breaks is easy u just gotta be smart boost ur ratings up find the best products if ur dealing with sorting. I use couple bathroom breaks and stay in for 15 min every time. They do not come looking for me even tho I Been inactive they mainly to see if ur ratings are good. But that depends on the manager but don’t be lazy and they don’t be on u. If u taking bathroom breaks go to the one up front because they have trackers at the one on the side and the back. Hit bathroom breaks towards break to fit in more and use the stall don’t be dumb and just get on ur phone in the bathroom managers walk in all the time and will make u clock out. Only thing they care is being late after the paid break trust me that’s the only things that will hurt them. Try to aim for waterspider position . U won’t be track cause u ain’t scanning nothing and u moving around that’s better than staying in one place all day. Amazon is easy if u already had jobs when u were a teenager most people complain because of their lifestyle they are dealing with kids and bills but if ur young the job is gon be easy for u just a long one task job. I recommend getting cool with ur managers u don’t have to tell them stuff just get cool with them that way u can ask to switch different positions and tbh they don’t be looking for u. Now do not get on no females I repeat I see many guys try to talk to females they are the number reason to get u fire. They will snitch and get u caught up and are the most distractions . Do not make any friends if ur are make sure its the right one. They can cause u to be late and distraction u dont wanna get distracted on any job site due to the fact ur gonna get comfortable and managers gon think u not taking it seriously. Mind ur business don’t be a snitch trust me once a person knows ur a snitch u wont be liked and they’ll find anyway to get u fired. Overall Amazon is depends who can handle it or not. Now the job sucks but the money is good especially for young people. Do not try to be a person who wanted to move up quickly that will bite u quick. I’m only there cause it pays the most out my city and plus I got a degree and IT their IT jobs are easy and chill so w is win. For older people with kids I would rather aim towards flexible schedule if no choice ofc the jobs gon be suck unless ur some manager but every job is like that there’s a reason Amazon pay more they know their gonna work their employees off so find something u feel comfortable even if it pay less but if u have no choice then that’s something people have to deal with honestly living is a scam anyway. Hope this help anyone. Oh yes try to aim for fulfillment center small Amazon are much easier bigger ones are much strict and has trash manager and longer walks.,Positive

Lyqo2uJvNO4,"I've been there for over 3 years and I really like it.  Yes, the place can be a dumpster fire but that is because they will hire anyone with no brain cells.  Then you get entitled workers that don't care about anything because ""you don't pay them enough"".  Ridiculous!  The jobs at Amazon are definitely not high skilled. 
I have a great dept and have always had terrific managers but communication can be a problem and don't get me started on HR/ERC. 🥴
You can't beat the benefits, though. And as long as you have time off accrued you can come in late, leave early...all without hearing BS from management.  All through the app.  And you get $5200/yr for school (don't even have to be reimbursed!)

Many young people only look at the money per hour but benefits are extremely important, especially in the USA.",Positive
Lyqo2uJvNO4,"Hello All, I currently work as A fulfillment associate at a Amazon warehouse, and I have to agree with the other comments based off what Jordan expresses in his video regarding interactions with those who worked at Amazon.

Lyqo2uJvNO4,"I've been there for 4 years. My old building was good for 2 years, but it just absolutely spiraled downhill. I had to get out bc my injuries were getting too bad. I had a back injury from unload 12-15k boxes a night. My back literally would freeze for 20 sec at a time and I couldnt move. Took 6mo of PT and even now im getting random episodes of that from my desk job. Lower back is just F'ed. Then I got really bad shoulder pain. The initial injury was from doing arm circles at home but theres no shot working at Amazon wasnt to blame and was the reason I needed PT for that (but of course they didnt cover it bc I saw a doctor on my off time). But calcific tendonitis isnt something that happens overnight. Amazon did that to me. Doing a desk job there now, but im doing two peoples jobs and getting paid for the wages of the cheaper one. Really want to quit but Idk any other company that will give me the vacation time I need so im kind of trapped. 

Honestly just need to become independent or move to Europe -_-",Negative

Lyqo2uJvNO4,"Great video. I worked for 3 years at Amazon at Outbound. I used to scan boxes, load the truck and  TDR. The break room was about 10 minutes from my work station. I only had 5 minutes to eat. During my 30 minute lunch break, it was a 10 minute walk. Another 10 minutes on line to wait for the microwaves and only 5 minutes to eat. No air conditioning. There were times when the food machines were empty on my break. If your unpaid time goes negative, you get terminated. So, don't get sick because they don't give any sick days because you would have to use your upt, pto or vacation time. One day they wanted me to load 2 trucks at the same time without any help. I just walked out. I wasn'tgoing to risk my physical health again. That was my last day. Before I quit, I used up my remaining PTO and vacation time. I felt so much happier by quiting.",Positive

I discovered that not all buildings are the same and the one I'm at is pretty laid back for the most part. Maybe a bit too laid back with all the shit people get away with here. Although I don't work at Amazon FT anymore as I have a ""real job"" outside of Amazon it's not the worst place to work, like not at all. Then again maybe my perception of Amazon is skewed a bit because I'm PT there and I only work when I choose to pick up a shift and no one is making me be there. The one thing I always tell people when they first start off is Amazon only cares about Amazon and will do what is best for Amazon. The faster you understand that, the better off you'll be. Then again that's pretty much any job tbh lmao 

Another thing about Amazon I wish someone told me was that this place is literally like going back to HS all over again. Honestly, it might be worse than high school lmao",Positive

Lyqo2uJvNO4,"I've worked at amazon for 6 years. 5 of those years were as a tier 1 associate, across  3 departments, 2 buildings and rotated over 30 managers due to normal manager rotation (Managers rotate very frequently here). Never once have I gotten in trouble for time off task, and I've definitely gone to the bathroom as needed, filled my water bottle as needed, etc. Time off task won't show unless you've been idle for over 50-60 minutes (don't know the exact amount).

There are definitely bad managers, and it's definitely a stressful place, both mentally and physically. It is not a place to dedicate your life to. It's a place to come, get paid, and see where else you want to go. They give great starting pay for completely unskilled labor and offer great career opportunities, including fully paid college, so it works out perfectly if you're trying to do just that. But if you can go somewhere where you get paid better, if you have that possibility, there is no reason not to go for that.

If you're unskilled and have no immediate opportunities, amazon won't even interview you and you get paid almost $20 as a base. Just expect that you will be working. And you can go to the bathroom! If a manager tells you the opposite, raise it one level, or go to HR. As long as you're doing your job and didn't take 70 minutes watching a movie on the bathroom, there's nothing that they can do.",Positive

I think some people just not made for warehouse jobs and I can see that a lot. The thing I see more is a lot of young guys getting caught up chasing behind these young females.",Positive
Lyqo2uJvNO4,"Here's the thing. Treat these jobs as a gig, not a career. I worked at Procter and Gamble for a winter season, and I took every single piece of overtime they would give me. I was banking around 1200-1300 a week after taxes (which for the state and city I was in was BANK). I stayed there for a couple months with my head down and ended up walking away with several thousand dollars in savings, got my truck fixed up, had a good christmas with my family, bought a couple personal toys and then moved to a new state and started my own thing.

There were people in there who looked like they were 1 day away from jumping off the roof but they weren't seeking other work, they had no exit strategy, they took every day off they possibly could, would leave everytime there were too many people on shift etc. 

There's no denying that it sucked and the people for the most part were awful. I come from the construction world too, so all the rules and brown nosing were totally new to me. But I never let anyone with a bad attitude or who was on a power trip effect me. Just nod and so yes sir/mam please and thank you. 

If you're smart about it and willing to just concede that trading a couple months of your time is going to make you a good amount of money, these types of bean counter jobs can really be a means to an end if you play the game and have some mental fortitude.

That being said, I dont recommend it to everyone lmao.",Positive

Lyqo2uJvNO4,"Same applies for Costco. Sure, you can go to the bathroom but get permission first. You have to clock out for lunch…which is a maximum of 30 minutes. If you take 31 minutes or longer, you get warned. Three warnings, you get written up. During your first 90 day trial period, you cannot take more than two days off in a row. You have no single supervisor telling you what to do. The person you are paired with tells you what to do and how to do it. They all have different ways of doing things. If you say, I was told by “Jim” to do it this way, the reply is always “I’m not Jim.” It is a bully culture. There aren’t documented procedures or training for many regular tasks.

You had 30 minutes for lunch and if you took too many bathroom brakes I was to counsel them. In addition, it was my job to fire people based on a supervisor’s documentation. The pay was awesome but my higher self thought these employees have to be stressed out their minds! I’m going to fire them and they return gunning for me?? Halfway through the interview I politely told him I didn’t want to waste his time or mine because I could never see myself working for such an authoritarian company that abuses its employees in that manner and walk my happy out and went home.",Negative
Lyqo2uJvNO4,"maybe it's cause I live in the midwest as a warehouse associate, but this has not been my experience at all. To be fair tho I am currently looking for a new job just because they only pay 17.50 and the only schedule I can get is start time at 3:00pm, 8:00pm or overnight. But otherwise it's been pretty chill, you can leave your station to get bathroom breaks or a cup of water and nobody will be on you, the managers are like well like people 🤷🏾‍♀ they not like mean people, sometimes if they talk to you it might be annoying because you might be on a position that isn't getting a lot of work and will move you to another that has more work, but the work itself is pretty easy to just zone out to. Tho, ig to be nice you might have a random encounter where a manager will just come up to you and ask how your doing, which gets pretty funny cuz I'm usually trynna just zone out but I usually appreciate the effort.",Positive

Yes there is room or improvement, where or what job doesn't?  Instead of bashing the Amazon name, maybe people should consider working with the tools provided and communicate issues with HR on site and so forth up the chain of command to resolve site issues.  Perfection is not going to happen over night, but if the problems are not brought to the attention of the people who can fix it, then nothing will change for the better.",Positive

HHujfrRiWEI,Yes I also was a former employee of Amazon and its a sweatshop it should be illegal in all 50 states it's a horrible horrible place to work you see how big it is you supposed to get 15 minutes for break but they don't tell you that you have 5 minutes a walk time in that 15-minute break then you're so cold half an hour lunch is actually 20 minutes if you have a find a place to sit in the ones room or even if you make it to the lunch room some places you just make it to your locker cuz you can't use your telephone or cell phone on the floor most of the employees just eat their lunch at their locker and then they go back to packing or whatever they have to work at Amazon is an absolute joke. Then around 3:30 3:45 here get your final break but you got to remember you have to put in guac time so it was only 10 minutes but don't even think about going to the bathroom at Amazon because if you go to the bathroom and your production goes down you can lose your job that way too Amazon is an absolute joke I will never work there again👹👺🤥🤥,Negative

HHujfrRiWEI,"People want their stuff when they order online they usually do not think about how they get their items they just want them now and fast plus not damaged. I've worked at Walmart fulfillment, target doing fulfillment &  Amazon which each one is different now I left them all due to the companies greed not quality nor for the customer. I see Target losing a lot of online customers & money because when I picked the items most of them are not where they should be due to the fact customers place them elsewhere in the store so it is not at the location. I see why it is best to have a center where customers do not shop to get to the product & know it should hopefully be there. Most of these warehouses have dates of items that have expired and are still stowed. At Amazon people get write ups for not being productive when it is impossible to stow items because it is overfilled. Amazon seems to be a storage for items no one buys they make money monthly from people who sale through Amazon those items no one wants nor buys so the bins are too full to add anything. People work at these places because they want to be there those who do not, leave to find work elsewhere. Hopefully people know they should not be forced to work in a job they do not want to work at most of the workers I see do not really work they walk around and talk. They get their numbers because they take smaller items from others and that is how they keep their job and low rates while others work hard and get written up than fired . These companies will always stay in business because people will work there nothing anyone can do unless people stop supporting these type of businesses which will never happen because people want stuff. I have a business to help people start college by helping them apply to school & get them financial aid many have started their own companies & now have better careers. These jobs are to help you get a start while going to school or help pay bills but mostly these types of warehouse jobs are temp & people are replaceable to these companies which is why it is best to start your own business and get paid doing something you enjoy.",Positive

I honestly think that without amazon I would not have developed myself to be as strong of a leader as i am today. I took what I learned from there and now at just 22 years of age I'm a high ranking manager for target and make more than my friends who finished school. Of course I am still enrolled myself and will still get my degree, but i give a lot of thanks to this company for giving me opportunities.

I will never tell anyone to work at Amazon (I have heard horror stories at places like BFI9), but I feel like I actually got in a good place and I got good management. Im actually getting trained in packing next week, and im pretty excited about it. I feel respected and trusted in a place where that's almost impossible.

wMEauuKV0BU,"1) Some of these issues are not Amazon-specific issues, but warehouse company issues. As in it's not just Amazon doing it, so don't get it twisted, you go anywhere else that has a warehouse, expect the same stuff.  It does seem like every person in HR or Learning that I talk to, tells me something different than the previous person did. But I suspect that's true of any company. Also their app can be very confusing, but again, I assume that's not only an Amazon problem, although since it IS a problem, they really should have people who deal with that specifically.

2) I've heard some horror stories, and I won't deny some are/were true, but I think a lot of it depends on the location you're working at. So far I haven't run into too much trouble, but I've only been there for a couple of months. And I want to stress, I came from another warehouse company that had longer shifts, so a shorter shift with more break time was a breath of fresh air, even for lower pay. One thing I can say is my location isn't as fixated on scan rate as my last job was. Possibly to their detriment, as we constantly have people clocking in, then hiding in the parking lot or worse, the restrooms, which prevents people who are actually working from doing what they need to do. As for managers, here you also don't really know who yours is, because you don't really belong to one department, they send us all over the warehouse, so in a week you may interact with five or six different managers. But as a plus, if there's a manager you don't like, odds are you won't have to deal with them every single day. They do claim you can request to work in a specific part of the building, but that seems to be most effective for people with accommodations, and even then they can't avoid it all of the time.

And as for the asthma, he definitely should have gotten some sort of accommodation for that. I can tell you there are people at my location who are deaf, or have autism, or have bad legs, and they still have jobs somehow. And that is despite some of them doing far less work. And yes I know how that sounds, but when you are tired and doing your best to stay on task, and you look up and see the autistic guy walking by humming to himself for a whole hour without doing any work, all I can think is, ""Must be nice."" Maybe you have to stay on them about it, and report it if they don't adjust your tasks enough. I do recall a pregnant woman had a similar issue, not sure what she did about it. But on that note, the only advice I can give is not really helpful: I would not choose to work in a warehouse if I were pregnant or planned to be, or if I had any sort of medical condition that prevented me from moving with speed or regularity, because that's exactly what they want from you. To me it kinda seems like applying to work at a restaurant but you know the smell of food makes you ill, why would you do that to yourself?",Negative

If you have asthma, you shouldn't work in a warehouse, no matter the company. I also think telling your employer what you want do, doesn't fly, especially when you are the one with your hand out, asking for a job so that you can get some of their money.

Management is absolute dogshit (Safety management in my experience at my local delivery warehouse, area managers and learning ambassadors actually seem to care a lot and even took off some of my ToT and the automatic warnings from ToT due to my issue). My foot before starting got sprained so I had issues with it. Asked to sit-down for like 5 minutes so i could apply my lidocaine patch for pain relief and take my prescribed medication for it because I almost rolled on my left ankle THREE TIMES while doing pick n pull during the final 2 hours of my 12 hour shift and the pain was just overall bad on that foot to the point i was limping and could barely walk on that foot. They really sat there and asked me 900000 questions, had the audacity to ask ""How come your right foot isnt as bad as your left"", and then tried asking if im just doing all this to avoid doing work when I was working above rate when doing stowing, 80% of which was heavy oversized packages. Safety management is an absolute joke and they just want to make sure that it isn't an amazon related injury WHILE working us like robots.

QHXET1G9Y5U,"I needed to see this video. ♥ The feeling you're describing, that paralysis and complete inability to focus, I was there in 2022. Only, I didn't trust myself to find another well paying job, so instead of quitting after 2 months, I quit after 2 years, when I could absolutely not hold on any longer. I didn't turn to drugs, but I was a zombie for the rest of 2024. Basically all I did for months on end was let my nervous system decompress. 

Then in 2025, I focused on my physical health and building better regulation. I did a ton of work on myself, looking back I find the person I used to be almost completely unrecognizable, but I still avoided programming. Too many negative emotions associated with it, combined with the fear of falling behind in a shitty job market. There was a knot in my stomach every time I opened my laptop. 

Now it's 2026, and I'm slowly getting back into the habit of learning. I'm focusing on consistency over high pressure. I'm hoping to get back on the horse, this time with firmer hands on the reigns. Cheers!",Negative

I started at the very bottom in the company and ended at the very to evaluating emerging technologies the firm wanted evaluated, real cutting edge only under NDA agreement concepts.  Never made crazy money, but good money, I never made more than 140 as base salary.

QHXET1G9Y5U,Thanks man this is what I needed to hear honestly. I have been looking for a job for months now. First I learned Front-end but there are no front-end jobs so then I learnt full stack still no jobs now I have said fuck learning and am working on projects directly while doing leetcode questions daily side by side. My next goal after projects is AWS certification for practitioner and Hacker rank certificates for basic things like java. Even tho what I need to do is clear currently I still feel that pit in my stomach everyday and am having anxiety. I do not even know where this anxiety has come from suddenly but not having a job for months after graduation and the fear of dissapointing my parents who have never pushed me into anything and always given me time for everything is the biggest reason probably. I feel like I can fall apart everyday. Maybe I should also have daily ritual of reading something to calm my anxiety like you.,Negative
QHXET1G9Y5U,I love you dude. I'm glad things worked out.,Positive
QHXET1G9Y5U,7:34 Dude... me too. I used to cry and vent with my car parked along the sidewalk of the park near my house and start writing my feelings on my Smartphone's notepad.  I always felt weird for doing that. I have not quitted yet. Probably after this year. But your Amazon gig was definitely much more stressful than mine.,Negative

QHXET1G9Y5U,"@NeetCode I totally understand you! I had a pretty similar experience...but for me it was during for.. 1 year and two or three months, and I almost had diabetes because of stress! And I have a conclusion: the manager means everything at Amazon

If your manager is a good manager, the life in that team is good and your mental health is the same. 

If your manager is stupid, not only you... all the team members will have problems. The job of a manager is not just to participate to meetings, the most important task is people management!!!

Do everything that's good for you and don't put your soul in the work at a corporation. A corporation doesn't worth it.",Positive
QHXET1G9Y5U,2:35 This story is not convincing to me. Of course not welcoming new Engineer to ask questions is so bad but it does not necessarily immediately cause anxiety and quitting. There should be a process. I didn't hear it. It's like the manager said this and you are done.,Negative
QHXET1G9Y5U,"I worked at Amazon. Its a terrible place, everyone works there to save their on spot in the team.

QHXET1G9Y5U,"Amazon will pay the wage increase and benefits package, hopefully the sweat shop/unsafe working condtions/profit sharing issue will be addressed. However the cost is going to be passed on to consumers. I hope yall enjoyed those cheap prices. Because those past prices are now going away like the 99 cent cheese burger. The burger joints were forced to pay 20.00 hr for unskilled labor in Cali. So the consumer ate it. Those jobs were never designed to live on. They were for kids going to school to learn a skilled trade or job like Nursing or engineering. Sadly pensions and social security payments will not be going up. So the gap of poverty will get wider.Pushing the old folks  out to shit holes like Blythe and Needles Ca. and homeless camps. But nobody cares. The rich get richer the poor get poorer...and so it goes. I tell the young people of today. Get paid for what you know. Go into the military if u cant pay for college. There is no easy way to the top. Leave the dope and get rich schemes for the losers... Do the right thing. Honesty and integrity seems to be in short supply these days.

i0Bx7ioky5g,"Fellow Amazonian here (corporate). I'm resigning tomorrow - this video helped me make peace with the decision (though the decision-making process was months long). It's both scary and exciting, but everything you mentioned here resonated so much with me! It's time, after nearly 8 years. I'm 30, single, living within my means with financial comfort, and ready to move into a season of life where I can pursue self-employment and freedom - ultimately with the goal of being a work-from-home, stay-at-home mom long-term (if God blesses me with a husband and kids someday) or simply just being a single woman with freedom! That path isn't necessarily celebrated in society, but after seeing what society/the world has to offer, not all that glitters is gold. I've checked the box for ""hanging in there"" and ""paying my dues"" in a corporate job at Amazon, and it's time for a new season and new way of life.

i0Bx7ioky5g,"Wow, such a powerful video.  I can attest to everything you said.  I want to share that I am with my company for 30 years now, so your point about loyalty was hard to fathom. 
I am also close to quitting my job/company after close to 30 years, I work for a huge corporate company and given my everything for the ""3% per year"" annual increase and many years, this was barely enough to cover inflation.  We were not even lucky to get any equity plans as it is a private company.  I have finally realised this is not a good situation for me and my family.  
I am in the searching phase now, where I can use everything I have gained in the last 30 years and maximise my potential, and your video was very inspirational. Thank you.",Positive
i0Bx7ioky5g,"I watched this video expecting to find some relatable experiences.
But fortunately for me, I can honestly say that my career at Microsoft was very much the opposite experience of Brian's at Target & Amazon.
Now I can see better how retiring early could be such an imperative for some.
Perhaps better than to regularly jump across positions/companies, ever chasing that corner office or salary bump, is to find a job/career which amounts to a personally rewarding creative outlet (engineering, in my case) and stick with it. ... 
And wisely invest your salary, of course.",Positive

Coincidentally, this happened around the time staff at a distribution centre decided to unionise, something Amazon 😊😊couldn’t fight because of the province’s strong labour laws. They’re expanding their warehouse capacity in cities on the other side of the provincial border and will be fulfilling deliveries from there. Since then, I’m seeing fewer and fewer Amazon boxes on local doorsteps.

I’ve always been aware of Amazon’s anti-union stance but ignored it until it affected my community. I’m also opposed to their mandatory return to office policy.

How did I get there? In short, Amazon's high bar mentality (nothing you ever do is good enough), competition between colleagues, constant lies by management, moving goal posts, etc.. It's hard to stay mentally sane when you work all the time, you achive 4x more than any regular employee in a similar role at a different company, you know you are world-class level, yet you're told you're trash all the time and you get put on PIP. One year after I left I still have anxiety attacks and I can't say I am well, I'm afraid I'll never be as I was before Amazon. It was truly traumatic.

I escalated to her boss and insisted that I get a 360 eval because my boss had no concrete examples of why I was on PIP (mainly platitudes of her feelings of how I was performing). As an aside, I was open to specific feedback on how I could improve, but she didn’t have any to give me. No way to get off PIP if it is just vibes. When the eval came back, I ranked extremely highly from all levels, including getting praise from senior executives. That got my PIP removed immediately.

You get discounts on all orders.😮 I have had years of great times with many of my coworkers. For the first time in my life not just a few but many different ppl who actually know how to have fun.🎉 That was needed cause I worked form home during COVID. That's when Jeff was the CEO I'm not to crazy about the new vibe. Jeff played no games. We never had to worry about taking the stupid vaccine. And we got a three dollar raise in just two weeks. Plus full time employees got to go to school free for career development and promotions.Even though it particular warehouse was drastically under performing.Two tips and this will be a awesome job have a sliding base/performance pay. That will keep diversity, reward those who are able to push harder.  And not hurt those who just wanna clock in be productive and clock out. 2. Stop putting full time employees on a pedestal.

My position was simply scanning packages all night, and a lot of the negative claims you hear—like “you can’t take breaks” or “they overwork you”—just weren’t true for me. They offered plenty of benefits, not only for employees but also for their families. Schedules were flexible, there was PTO and VTO, and you could pick up extra shifts if you wanted to earn more.

Yes, the work can be a bit tiresome and repetitive, especially during peak season (I worked through COVID), but it was far from unbearable. The pay was also better than what I earned at other jobs afterward. Maybe I was lucky with my location, but my experience was positive overall.

If you’re curious, I’d say give Amazon a try—they’re always hiring, and you might be surprised. I worked third shift, kept to myself, and found the environment manageable and even pleasant at times.",Positive

Slave work is a crazy phrase. Amazon is a very annoying company to work for, but they pay pretty good for the unskilled labor your doing. Usually 20+ an hour in any position. Also, delivering for Amazon aint that bad, but it also aint for lazy people. I delivered over 300+ packages a day. On average it was about 200 stops a day.

7I4_JCgyygU,Amazon pays the most over Usps and FedEx. We also get the lightest amount of packages with it usually being a majority small envelopes. I've seen UPS FEDEX have to deliver 300 to a 1000 packages and some are over a 100 pounds. Yes they expect u to do a route in 10 hrs but what they don't tell is that breaks are not mandatory and Amazon is not taking into account that humans need a true break to stay productive not 2 minute breathers. The routes can be done in time but taking a full 30 minutes will have u behind and it's honestly the law in most states to not get one it sucks. U have most other companies who are out all day literally 12hours getting paid 15 to 18 am hour at USPS but FedEx pay  800 to 1200 a week but with a longer work week for less pay. The problem is the laziest people work then want a million bathroom breaks especially in the warehouse  most other companies only hire part time and they kill u for less pay 10 - 15 an hour. The job is to do what needs to be done to get packages to the customer in a certain time. People want to be paid to do nothing 🙄 and that's just not going to happen 😒. The future isn't bright I don't think people understand these companies are close to delivering without employees,Negative

He is telling the truth, the better you are the more work you get. It’s robot work for sure. Most drivers pee in empty bottles if they can’t find a restroom. Mandatory lunch break, but if you get behind they normally won’t send you help.

uI3dTs1aB1s,"Well, this is a strange phenomenon in the world where a labourer sweating it out in the sun gets only some wages and one meal, while someone sitting in Air conditioned offices makes slightly more doing mentally challenging work.  The per day earning would be almost the same for an entry level executive and a labourer. (Provided labourers are getting high wages like those in Kerala)..

However, let me share my personal experience of working in Amazon DC as a Content Reviewer in VSE (Video Shopping Experience). If you have been under impression that there is only software development happening in these companies then better modify the perception.

As an entry level executive, you have to be a girl, or a cunning guy who can smoke with your mentor during breaks to get progress. At least, you are not supposed to find flaws in the system. Some people who joined at the initial launch of the operations in India, had a headstart and even though having pathetic skills in verbal and written communication, they became the big politicians in the office. As a teetotaller, non smoker and having a better skill in communicative English, my fellow senior colleagues and managers felt threatened and played politics to keep my productivity lower. While the experienced fellows used unethical tricks to jack up their productivity with support of manager, I was in constant monitoring for not using the same tricks. 

Even though I worked my ass off everyday, from start to end of the shift, my productivity was short of 90-95 percent. I never used the recreation room for even a second in my 9 months of stay. I still found it a good job at Amazon as the shift timings were so comfortable and I had two weekly holidays on Saturday, Sunday. And of course the office facilities and food courts are world class. 

Recognition was missing for me. Even for non core work efforts too. I recall creating an RandR (Rewards and Recognition) graphic poster for an office competition but my suggestion only completed after the announcement of the winners. Everybody was congratulating me for the innovative idea. But that effort also got no official recognition.

Maybe I was just unlucky to get a bad team. Anyways, I could not stay longer as I had to resign abruptly when my ageing father fell sick and I had to return home to continue in his retail business.

It's not meant to scare anyone. Maybe it was my age factor also that prevented my team to have a better relationship with me as I was slightly older in age to my senior colleagues and managers. Anyways, after realising so many other people expressing their nightmares in various private and Government jobs, I feel maybe it's best to leave things to destiny.",Positive

uI3dTs1aB1s,"I have worked in a BPO, a startup, a small enterprise, a huge IT MNC and Amazon. Amazon is the worst organisation to work for. They mess up your life and mental health like no joke. The ones who are saying that Amazon is a good company, are lying through the teeth. Its the biggest farce there is. Nobody gives a f**k about work, process, efficiency, continuous improvement, performance, better management, work life balance or anything remotely relatable. All they care about is PIP, screen tracker, who is coming to office on which day at what time, who is spending how much time for lunch, etc.
I am currently working for an IT giant, and they provide AWS certification for free. But drumroll... Amazon charges their own employees for AWS certification, followed by a bond.
I worked with 2 great managers in Amazon, but it physically hurts to see their managerial potential dead by the neck. They are literally, I mean literally, forced to put people on PIP for reasons so silly, you will want to kill yourself. Oh and the ones talking about the great pay? Boy you have absolutely no idea what scam they are running in the CTC. Oh and by the way, the managers who tried to do the right thing by refusing to adhere to such nincompoop policies, have been thrown out or are currently serving PIP. I can go on and on and on.
So to the people who say they ""love working for Amazon"" - you skill-less, spineless, worthless losers are going to die serving the scam behemoth, because you are too useless to get any job outside.

Amazon prides itself in being a leader and innovator, but it truly doesn't do a great job in vetting or continuously checking how sites are ran from a cultural and moral standpoint. And that my friends is a huge issue. These 14 to 16 leadership principles the company prides itself as living or running by is not what it seems, unfortunately.",Negative

wzOGAQhFpew,"1. **Amazon's Four-Year Cliff**: The speaker left Amazon due to the ""four-year cliff,"" where stock compensation heavily diminishes after the initial four years.
2. **Compensation Breakdown**: At Amazon, compensation includes base salary and ""bridge cash"" in the first two years, with stock vesting as follows: 5% in year one, 15% in year two, and 40% each in years three and four.
3. **Bridge Cash Removal**: By year three, bridge cash ends, and employees rely solely on stock, which fluctuates with market performance.
4. **Stock Market Risk**: This structure can be a gamble if Amazon's stock price declines, impacting total compensation in the later years.
5. **Promotion Disadvantages**: Promotions increase workload with minimal pay increase, and newly promoted employees are placed at the lower end of their new pay band.
6. **External Opportunities**: The speaker notes that similar roles outside Amazon offer higher pay, bonuses, and new stock options, often with fewer responsibilities.
7. **Talent Retention Strategy**: Amazon’s compensation structure discourages long-term retention to avoid employee complacency, pushing employees to seek external opportunities after four years.
8. **Importance of Market Value**: The speaker emphasizes regularly assessing one's value in the job market to ensure career and financial growth.
9. **Personal Decision**: Leaving Amazon was beneficial for career development and financial reasons, as it allowed the speaker to take on new challenges and responsibilities.
10. **Conclusion**: The speaker finds fulfillment in new learning experiences, contrasting with the routine, automated nature of tasks in long-term roles.",Positive

So i tried to return it the next day after i left a negative review on this product with a photo of how it got delivered, a few hours afters i left this review my account got suspended and the review removed.

After some trouble i got emailed a return code that was not accepted by UPC or UPS, so after visiting 5 shops that would return my package but refused the code i called Amazon again, they send me a wrong code and now send me the correct code. It worked with the first place i delivered it to.

wzOGAQhFpew,"My son went from working hard on a hay farm to being a package driver for Amazon for one dollar more an hour. He loved it at first but that love quickly wore off. As he kept making his delivery time goals each week, they kept pushing him more and more without any bonuses. It was never good enough. He was working 12-hour shifts. He was exhausted,  going up flights upstairs carrying packages daily. 
The better he was, the more they worked him until he completely gave out. Once he tripped on a step and he was terrified to tell management so he wouldn't get yelled at n get a mark against him or get fired. I cleaned his elbow and super glued his elbow skin together and put butterfly stitches on it send sent him back to work. 
A year later, after 2 years of no raises, tighter goals to meet, no recognition for safety, and reaching his goals, he gave up n quit.

wzOGAQhFpew,This idea of constantly changing and moving on is great and sounds fitting in some of these tech jobs but not necessary stable for the general working family. Someone with a few kids likely wants something that can cover their family for a while versus having to constantly switch things up every 4 years. And it's also easier when you're still younger; obviously that's what companies like Amazon are betting on.,Positive
wzOGAQhFpew,"I'm also ex-Amazon. Was there for just under 6 years. One point of perspective on the 4-year cliff, my understanding is that it's set up that way not only to stave off complacency, but it's in essence an ""up or out"" dynamic. Meaning, you're expected to either move up or move on. That's why the pay levels are structured to fall at the 4-year mark. But at review time, you can be rewarded with additional RSU's that enable you to maintain your comp level as an IC (individual contributor) even if you're not pursuing a promotion (which is what happened for me and why I stayed past the 4 years despite not moving to L7), which can be a difficult hill to climb.",Positive

I was an L4 Loss Prevention Specialist and was on a mission to become an L5 Multi site Loss prevention site l, and yes it will be more work with more buildings to be charge of, so I had to think about what I’ll be making more based on what I’m making now. Don’t get me wrong everyone goal is to get promoted to make more money , but a boatload of more work and stress for a slight bump in salary just wasn’t worth the extra stress and headache. Knowing what I have learned at Amazon during my time there, I just applied everything I had learned into a similar role at a different company as an L5, with higher pay without the boatload of extra stuff thrown at you. Amazon leadership positions do hold a lot of weight, so that’s a plus altogether.",Negative

wzOGAQhFpew,I find it incredible how far the first world and third world is apart. My father's generation was the last generation that had permanent employment and they never saw anything close to the money you speak of. But now consider that they are highly educated and their work was extremely technical. I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon start using highly educated third world work force because they can pay them a fraction of what they pay just 1 single employee. My mind is blown really... And the sad part is you complain about your income... I guess even if you are paid in the millions of dollars it would still be considered low income? Because it seems that is the case here.

wzOGAQhFpew,"Another important thing you didn't mention: 15% stock growth rule. At year 3, amazn will give you new stocks for year 5 and 6, say 100K for each year. Instead of giving you 100K worth of stocks, amzn actually gives you: 100K/1.15 = 86.95K worth of stocks for year 5 and 100K/1.15 /1.15= 75.6K for year 6. So, what happens if stock price increase more than 15%? you should be thankful since you make more than 100K at year 5 or 6. did management ask you to be grateful (e.g you are making more than we want to give you). Yes; did hard work pay off? Absolutely No.",Positive

I mean if I'm going to get fired in two weeks i might as well find another job. The hours or days i can deal with but seems like to much pressure I'm not as young as i used to be.

wzOGAQhFpew,"This was really interesting! I'm thinking a lot about toxic corporate culture in general and struggling with accepting the boxes that we get put in as employees.

It almost seems that you are going to be financially well if the stock keeps going up, right?

o1-BUCdog1c,"Psychopathic company.
Only evil people work at these mega-corporations.",Negative
o1-BUCdog1c,"Several points to add to what Dave said:
1. the document that managers write to promote someone is called a promo doc, it's not the same as a 6-pager doc. but there's a template to structure the doc, and length limit (If I recall should be ~3-4 pages)
2. bar raiser is not always added to L4 interview loops (this was during  COVID era when Amazon was hiring a lot of poeple)
3. bar raiser's role is to maintain the hiring standards (thus the name bar 'raiser') and act as counter balance, as hiring manager would have natural inclination to hire the candidate (and grow their number of reports  - mentioned as the success metric for SDMs). It's more likely for SDM to be inclined and bar raiser not inclined, vs the other way round.
4. oncall - the operation load and emphasis on operational excellence varies a lot across orgs (and sometimes even across teams in an org). obviously this would be depenent on the services' impact on customer/business when an outage happen. not all teams work on tier-1 systems that could trigger SEV-1. for some teams, the highest sev they can cause is a SEV-2, and subsequently the oncall can be pretty chill.
5. good managers bringing people with them to new org - this helps bring new ideas but there are also cons. It's great when the new org's problem domain is similar to the old one, but there are also times when new management brings a lot an influx of people with senior titles but have little domain knowledge 
6. team autonomy in choosing tools they want - in practice there's a strong preference to use AWS and/or internally supported frameworks to build software. there's also 'not invented here' syndrome that makes it hard to use external products/solutions. Once in a while there are teams that do things their own way like the team that built a service in Lisp, but as Dave mentioned those often end up being scrapped and rewritten after the original engineers leave.",Positive
o1-BUCdog1c,"The description of how someone gets PIP’ed at AMZ is a bit disingenuous. Dave says at 54:58  the description of a low rating/letting someone go is not necessarily that they are “not meeting expectations” but rather that they are merely the “least effective” team members.

But the company’s official policy, both what’s public facing and the official communications to individual employees, is that employees are PIP’ed because they are “not meeting expectations of the role”. (I was PIP’ed for the record. I was told I the “not meeting expectations” phrase many times).

It’s also company policy to not explicitly disclose a “Least Effective” to an employee.",Negative

HTOxxCRqpLM,So full of s***. I work in an Amazon warehouse in the States and it's nothing like described in these videos. I've never heard such a bunch of whining complainers in my life. It's the most laid-back environment I've ever worked in and we go to the bathroom when we please Nobody messes with us. you go in you do your job you go home. you get paid at the end of every week. it's a job people. it's work. You don't expect your work to be a Tiptoe Through the Tulips do you? they expect you to work not sit around and chit chat with your friends. We listen to music. all the people I work with and for are friendly. It's a good experience. You pick whatever shift you want to work and submit your application and Bam your hired from that point on it's very easy to get a job there.

HTOxxCRqpLM,"I was told if i wanted to keep working there I had to walk faster to the bathroom and when filling up water bottle on way back from my one break to the bathroom.  You have to start your scanner again once break is over and get it online again - that takes almost a minute to get it strapped on and actually scanning packages.  Even if you are standing there trying to get the thing working at your station - you are considered still on break until it works and you scan a package.  Your break isn’t considered over in the computer until you have scanned again.  And the thing has to be put back on your hand and arm - get the Bluetooth thing running again - that doesn’t matter - that is considered your break until the computer sees you are scanning packages.  So I was told to walk faster to have time to get the thing working again to get my break to be considered over when I can scan again - even tho I returned from breaks on time.  The scanner wasn’t operating magically as I appeared at my station - so that is considered the employees break time to get the companies equipment to work.  
It is so hot - even in winter - you have to drink water -  but just to be able to run to the bathroom and make it back without being called out for it is a big issue.  Even for women that need to go to the restroom for female things - better figure out a way to do it and keep the stuff you need on your person.  No bags allowed -  o phones allowed - you don’t know what time it is or how long you been gone.  It is impossible to succeed and be able to keep doing it.  High turn over means they are always paying starting pay rates for large percent of workers.  Very rough working conditions.  Very strenuous - which is ok - but you need water - need some damn air in hot ass building even in winter.  Now they are turning off water coolers so the water stays warm too.  Nice little bullshit thing they doing.  Everyone has been unplugged.  
I got to hand it to the people that can last there - you are tougher than I.   I will only do part time now - all my body can take without stroking out in there.  Some people can’t do the part time - feel very bad for them.  It’s brutal and you are constantly told you aren’t doing enough or you can’t pee fast enough or something.   They do lie about the wages too - I have seen those comments here as well - that is true.  I was bold face lied to about pay.  
UNION has to be better.  At least get cool water and a big fan (there are huge fans on ceiling but never turned on!!!) and a bathroom close enough to be  able to get to in decent amount of time so you don’t have to spend your break trying to get their crap equipment working again.",Positive

When we make the decision to work for someone else unfortunately we can’t tell them how to run their business , sometimes it’s better to create our own business so we can run it how we like,In the meantime LEAVE  Amazon if you are being humiliated, under valued and disrespected.

HTOxxCRqpLM,"I'm a retired U.S. Military Combat Pilot (26 years) I support these people 100%!! My daughter was hired as a delivery driver in Texas.  They ran her ragged, their feet were basically in her neck to perform.  Here is what she told us

1.  She  started out in a smaller truck, delivering 400 packages in her shift 

2.  She  was a hustler, she would return early for a  few shifts. They offered her to upgrade to their big Mercedes truck and added 3 additional bins of crap 600++ packages.  They told her the pay was gonna jump to $27.00 never happened 

She  was getting $16 per hour and not $27

3.  The trucks were unadulterated unsafe crap that should not have been on the road there maintenance program sucks. She would have trucks with the rearview mirrors or flopping could not get them to stay in place so when she had back up it was extremely difficult she was feared as she would run into another vehicle. The windshields on a couple of the trucks had cracks in the windshield next she said the tires were worn out an extremely low tread, the brakes were horrible and to make things worse they gave her to navigate all of these locations an Apple SE iPhone with a barcode reader on the back These items were worthless and consistent they would scan packages but a time she would have to scan scan scan before she actually scanned the package and it recorded the data she did this for three weeks

Finally in the middle of her shift with 4 bins still full she turned around and drive back to the warehouse and handed them the keys and phone.

She told them "" How can you with a good conscious expect us to deliver this chit in a safe manner. It's impossible.!I refuse to work under these horrible conditions and told I am officially resigning.  She  was very pleasant Az bout the whole thing.  She  also Tell the warehouse manager you promised me $27 an hour driving the Mercedes truck and delivering 600++ packages per shift and for the last three weeks on paychecks have averaged $16 an hour this is not right it's unfair and it's dishonest and she walked out the door good for her I support her 1000% I even Apple paid her $1000 to help her until she can find another job

Jeff Bezos is a slave driver how do you think he's made $290 million and personal wealth simple on the backs of his slaves personally they need to unionize if they don't they have a nationwide strike and Americans should boycott Amazon watch how fast conditions turn around if you think I'm gonna work 10 hours I have two breaks I have to walk a quarter of a mile to take a freaking leak I have another thing Comin screw A!!!!",Negative

You can see it starting to happen now. Kiosks to order at fast food instead of a real human. Self checkouts at all the grocery stores. A company only needs a skeleton crew after they automate these positions.

If I had to guess this was deeper than her not being scheduled and she not wanting to leave . I can almost guarantee they were messing with her, and to  exacerbate it even further, they called the cops to have her tresspassed.  
From the looks of it I can clearly tell who the instigating antagonist is. And If I was a betting man, it wasnt just her. They're never alone, they usually always roll in packs. 

Poor young lady. I'm so sorry she was humiliated and treated like this.

*Ive been to these distribution centers. I Walked around the Facility with only the steel frame and Foundation complete in 2018 near a Washington State Airport.
 ⚠️ A fire that big in a 4 million sqaure foot warehouse is not a big deal. Most of those 600 employees only herd about this on telegram and snapshot over an hour later. It takes you more than 10 minutes to walk across an amazon distribution center. Holiday bathroom walking times are about 15-20 minutes with forklifts and BoxBots and seasonal crew. You will have to relieve yourself into a Gatorade bottle from November to February, nationwide. I've always been required to use the Gatorade method at every job I've had since 1994. Many blue collar (no degree requirements) need tondo this on the job site everyday. 😅Big _ucking deal. This job is literally the easiest way to pay bills if you are not overweight and can read a phone well. You will not need to learn English to work at Amazon. They pay you a clean $100 cash daily and pay you the rest of your daily wage (40%) in a weekly Friday paycheck. 10% of your co-workers will sleep in a VW van on Amazon property and just Do Hookers & Blow 48 hours at a time. Amazon will give you a $120 Zappos shoe store gift card to get boots or saftey shoes. If you cannot afford to eat food the management will just write off warehouse food for you to eat or buy you pizza until your next weekly/Friday. This is a long standing regional ""goods defferment policy"" since Bezos Had Book Warehouses in Portland in the 90's. I'm a hometown guy and many of my hippy friends ate pizza hut at lunch provided from the Amazon management team perty cash fund, maybe this is 1998 or 2000. The free pizza is all they ate that day. Upon a local Areotech  headhunter calling me in 2020, Oct: what I herd then is the first warehouse  job pitch that provides immediate performance bonuses and benefits after six months. A $4,500 bonus after 90 days and a good performance review. 

⚠️  😢 The Amazon Corporate strategy is that you will outperform the Latina Grandma working the the left of you and the achoholic Iraq war vet to your right. The Amazon HR algorithm will terminate the employment those two nice people and call them ""inefficient labor assets."" Amazon will receive a labor injury insurance savings and you'll be real busy but you'll earn an extra $10+ a year just by out working your co-workers ◇◇ Rinse and repeat. 48 months later and now You drive a candy red Mercedes with carbon fiber brakes to the executive lot, some nice person parks it for you, you just walking around the warehouse drinking coffee and scrolling instagram pretending to observe this or that until lunchtime.

I don’t know but I think this video might not be giving us the complete story. I used to believe all the stories I heard until I starting working with them everyday. I hope that might shed a bit of light on this.,Positive

It was the next shift that showed up after the fire that didn’t get sent home. Fuck Amazon but fix your headlines,Negative
q6X7BAkEy-Q,Amazon is probably encountering a well coordinated campaign to cause whatever disruption it can. An Amazon worker is just a stand in for what will in the future will be an automated function. Continuous data collection must be very important to developing the AI needed to develop total automation.,Positive
q6X7BAkEy-Q,I think what Amazon does to their workers overall is wrong. And I’m sorry but it’s the only job the people can’t find. I believe Amazon should have to have unions in their buildings for all the workers. Hopefully something like this will get the ball rolling. I hope and pray everyone was OK after getting out of that building. Because now fires are not in buildings fire are not just wood and paper their chemicals that burn and let out smoke cause it’s very damaging.,Positive

I've been there for over 15 years in the Accounting Department and I'm ""White"".

The H.R. Manager and all of the other 'office personnel' are all relatively new.  The H.R. Manager and the newer female employees are all about the same age 30s and early 40s.  On several occasions the H.R. Manager will come into the open room that has many desks filled with the new employees who are her age and she will tell a 'deragotary' story -- which she will say at the end, ""You know, it must be a WHITE THING""!  She tells the story of an experience that she's had and at the end of it she says, ""Oh, yeah.  That's a WHITE THING""!   I'm the only white person in the room and it makes me feel slighted and degraded.

She has also called me into her office in a closed door meeting and tells me, ""You know, you don't have a lot in common with the younger girls in the office, you've never had any kids -- so if the other girls don't seem to talk to you that much -- it's just that they're younger and they have kids.""  Thus, giving me the reason as to 'why' I've been ostersized and ignored by my newer co-workers.  She actually said, ""You don't speak Spanish either, so you don't really understand what they're talking about.""

Everything was good, going out for morning coffees, etc, this work colleague turned on me after a few months.  I was singled out as a male in an all female office and HR organized the entire office to write identical accounts of why I made them feel uncomfortable in the workplace. So embarrassing. My wife and daughter had visited the office before, and everything seemed friendly, but told them things were not going well at work. I was told to go work at home by HR. My female manager is the only one who did not know this was going on, and had no idea why I was unable to work from the office, or that there was anything happening in the office (she worked in the office too!) The senior management located in another city took a hard line, and with no evidence against me, would not even tell me what allegations were made, closed ranks and refused to return my calls. I was left with no computer access to do work and was left in limbo for over a month. The company ghosted me. HR did not even contact me, and I notified them that my colleague (who got me the job) was threatening me via txt to leave the company, 'or I would never work in this town again' , and HR did nothing. I contacted my lawyer. Unfortunately, my lawyer had a conflict of interest with the company/law firm I worked for, but did not disclose this straight away. They recommended that I hand in my notice.

I was employed with Cubic Transportation System who work closely with Australian Government - Transport.

Since my joining, I was facing -

1. Gatekeeping of information, my accesses to different platforms were not getting sorted for months and I was given the vibe that it was on me.

2. Handover of equipments were delayed.

3. Constant bullying by my immediate manager.

4. Abuse sometimes got so extreme that my manager used to come to me while folding his sleeve. Yelling and shouting got kind of normalized.

5. Frequent threat to report me to HR. Although never got any clarification on what part would I be reported to!!

6. I was forced to come to the an almost empty office, 5 days a week where my manager was coming 2 days and another team member was coming once in every two weeks.

Finally, I decided to raise this issue to HR. No outcome as they felt the evidences were not enough to substantiate.


20 days later, day before yesterday I was called in for performance review. And 30 minutes long meeting lasted only 50 seconds where I was handed over the letter of termination. They made me erase all everything from the devices and submit it.

The following Monday When I spoke to the manager he tried to talk me out of it promising me that I wasn’t being targeted, 
If I Wasn’t being targeted then why was a write up given to me the same day right after I had applied for a promotion? And the write up is dated July 10, he waited a few days after I ask a promotion to hand it to me?🤔
Long story short, 

I have a supervisor and 2 leads are willing to testify in my behalf. After all, I was suspended and the supervisor kept working. So now They have submitted their position statements to EEOC, on the position statement they never mention anything about the incident that took place, their statements where based on how I staged multiple pallets in the wrong location. I just submitted a rebuttal arguing the fact that their Supervisor created a hostile work environment through his actions towards me, clearly the company is more focused on write ups than the issue.

This company has cameras everywhere. But they wouldn’t say who was doing it. When the verbal harassment started, I knew. Complaints to management went nowhere. When they sabotaged my booth, the cut the ac and disabled the heater. Over 120 degrees in the summer and 0 degrees in the winter. One time a pipe broke on a frig. The gas came in my open window and knocked me out. It was ammonia gas. When I complained to management they did nothing. I complained to the union, but they said the company can do what they want. When I called OSHA, they never came. I started getting sick, but didn’t know why. Then I got demoted to lowest job. I kept getting sicker, and had to retire early. Found out I had cancer after I retired. 5 things could cause my cancer. Radioactive exposure was one of them. I overheard a driver saying they had been dumping radioactive waste for years and there was a way to shut off the detectors. the doc said for a test, normal people are a 10. They get worried at 20.

Example, a group of employees have had assistants or secretaries as part of their job for several decades. Then, the company eliminates those assistant jobs and puts those responsibilities onto those employees who had them. The work loads increased, productivity decreased and the incoming work loads remained the same.  After time, the job was very difficult to complete as usual but then the company used the poor work results to cut pay increases/bonuses etc. At some point, many of those in that job group left the company which made it even worse for those who stayed. Then, were those who quit replaced? Not one for one which made the volume of work even worse and then we can talk about those out sick and on vacation and how production cycles got damaged. These managers and corporate greed infested VP's simply have no ethics nor do they give a hoot about their clients/customers as this activity progresses.

TJR9GWi1DZk,"Branigan Robertson, lucky me, I found you on YouTube! Your video's are educational and informative. I introduced them to my husband. My husband's been with the same company for the last 10 years. About 7 months ago, he was introduced to the new regional, who would be overlooking the property, the VP, new manager and assistant. Right away, not just my husband, but a co-worker as well, were treated so wrong. It was a complete take over and Not in a good way. My husband has endured abuse everyday by the managers her assistant, the regional himself. You see, they all know each other from other places of employment. The regional brought them to the property and from that day on, they totally dismantled everything, my husband needed and used to do his job. In other wards, they were sabotaging the way he performed his job duties. Wouldn't even allow him to make use the copy machine. They would always say, they are following the regionals orders. To make a long story short, while these people lie, are conniving and planning together, he and his co- worker get written up and suspended. Then they are invited back to work, only to suspend them again, over the same stuff. My husband went to HR, are you ever right, when you mentioned, HR will cheat you. HR decided to call herself and the regional ""HR business partners"" they do the investigation's. Being the fact the regional is friends with these other people, of course they never find any wrong in them. I wrote a letter to the HR persons boss, telling her how concerned, I am for my husband. I was able to sit in a meeting with my husband and the Chief of HR...her title. I told her, my husband is a changed man, I worry about his health, the abuse he takes on and so forth. She told my husband at the beginning, she would support him, that's not true. As you stated in this video, HR will change and defend ( side) with the perpetrators than the victim. This is exactly what happened today. Today, he was written up and given a final warning. All based on lies. He just returned from work, on Wednesday after his last suspension. The people who should be written up, are not. His co- worker upon return from his suspension, was written up 3 times, by the manager and HR agreed with it, all based on the managers lies. I saw on the BBB's website, they have no affiliation with the company and rate them an F+. The way the company treats my husband, effects him tremendously. At one point, my husband had to take a medical leave, the stress became too much, intolerable. As his wife, it pains me inside to watch him go to work and come home after being grilled all day, the look on his face, the stress is written on his face. He feels weak, sick to his stomach, we spend hours and hours without sleep. Meanwhile, the Chief officer of HR said in her investigation, she didn't find any harassment.  Unbelievable! She has no clue, she is not my husband, she has not walked in his shoes.  Sorry, this is so long.",Negative
TJR9GWi1DZk,"Thank you, Mr. Robertson; I have been busying myself with writing a book. I am Canadian, and I know you practice in California. Thank you for your efforts in educating a legally illiterate individual. I had been employed by the City of Ottawa for twenty-nine and a half years. I had distinguished myself as an elite operator, winning six annual bus Roadeo competitions. After twenty-one years of accident-free driving, I accepted a position in the training department as a Relief-Instructor. Aside from my workload doubling because HR failed to acknowledge an additional attrition rate of six hundred operators hired between 1974-75-76. 

Five colleagues and I were enrolled to attend a weeklong course facilitated by an outside agency, the Canadian Urban Transit Association (CUTA). January 21 - 25, 2008. 7:00 am to 4:00 pm, Monday to Friday. Unpaid homework until 1:00 am to 2:00 am with a one-hour commute to a different locale. This pace proved overly stressful for me due to how the assignments were distributed. I was assigned to convey the summary of the five previous segments facilitated by my colleagues. My assignment was the total of all the information my colleagues had previously taught. Each day was taking a more significant toll on my cognitive abilities. I succumbed to the ravages of a nervous breakdown. It was prescribed by my family physician to convalesce at home. The ailment progressed to include the trifecta of mental illnesses. Severe Depressive Disorder, a form of PTSD, Anxiety Disorder, up to and including Panic Attacks, and Bipolar Disorder.  

A far more significant effect was the loss of my family. These disorders proved too much for my spouse of thirty years. She initiated the separation and subsequent divorce. Three attempted suicides sealed my fate forever. These mood disorders have a way of diminishing my resiliency, self-esteem, and self-worth. My three children and seven grandchildren are now estranged under the tutelage of their mother/grandmother. A man's purpose in life is to find his purpose in life. 

I lost my employment via a pre-emptive constructive dismissal. No employer has the right to position its employees. In contrast, they can be held criminally liable for teaching in contravention of the Highway Traffic Act under the deception that an exculpatory agreement existed in the archives of City Hall. I attempted to secure a copy of the agreement to no avail. The Union Representatives were complicit in that they proved themselves to be inept.

I was demoted to my substantive position as a transit operator. I could not accept the term offered as the illegal maneuver persists today. There's a statute of limitation on my case. If so, I am vehemently opposed due to the ongoing unlawful practice. How can a statute have any forbearance on an issue when 1700 employees continue to execute the illegal maneuver?

Agencies and individuals who can no longer attest to having plausible deniability.

My boss (clinic director) was in the meeting. At our clinic, I have repeatedly asked for double books to be vetted through me (double books are not in our contract) and yet scheduling always adds double books without asking permission. Then in meetings our boss asks us to be leaders while not allowing us any autonomy. Another example is me asking to switch patients with other providers if I am seeing their patient and they are seeing my patient. My boss pulled me aside and told me to stop doing this. It is beyond ridiculous. The medical director has made disturbing jokes about firing a provider (PA like me or NP) right before and after he fired another PA. This was also after my write-up.

Thank you so much for reading til the end despite its length !",Positive
_Ng2egpbA7Y,"It doesn't make sense to skip a level despite what the company says. There's a reason for it not to be published similar to their naming conventions of facilities. Every now and then you'll find a facility's name, acronym, or nomenclature sequence # skipped somewhere. But I'll go on a tangent so that's another conversation.

About L2: it is more commonly understood to be considered Learning Ambassadors or LAs...rather unofficially. (Some people may even equate that to being part of a team like safety or part of the Loss Prevention Committee or ISS and so on. But I digress). LAs function as Leads or colloquially Lead Assistants to the PAs aka Process Assistants who in turn function similar to assistants to managers, particularly Area Managers as you stated. L5 managers can also be viewed as Sr (Area) Managers while L4 can be at times considered Jr. Managers. Both are officially known as Area Managers.

About L3 & below: people often confuse Level 3s as Tier 3s or Level 1s as Tier 1s and so forth interchangeably. 

Tiers (can also) describe your tenure within the company, despite your Level. 

For example, if you've been there for at least a year or a year ½, roughly speaking, that is “the next *tier* up”. A Level focuses more on your position within the company. Sometimes happenings within Amazon exceeds research. One has to be in the company or know knowledgeable Amazonians or (former/current/internal/external) customers to really understand the nuances. However, that doesn't necessarily apply to you since you're part of the culture.

More to the point, someone can be a Tier 3 being in the company for at least 2 years but still be at Level 1. Reasons vary but a common reason is that being Tier 3 with less responsibilities but more time within the company pays more than a Level 3 with more responsibilities with less time within the company. A con to that could be a slow progression to leadership roles for the Tier 1 associate vs the Level 3 associate. 

Also, if a Tier 3 (but still Lv. 1) decides after so many years to finally move up to a Level 3 position successfully, in many cases, their pay will be slightly reduced to start at that position's (L3's) pay rate instead of what they could make as a tenured Tier 3 employee. Communication around affected employees, indicated that there were a number of upset tenured Tier 3 associates who became Level 3 PAs but weren't previously aware of this.

For best results, put your bids in early for progression up the chain of command. And don't just only settle for the next step up. Go for several levels up instead to compensate, etc. Like Jalen Pappe in the comments. And he's only 19 too! Yet he misses -Tier 1- Level 1 for honorable or legitimate reasons, he's even more proud of his accomplishment of being a -Tier 3- Level 3.

Note: a Level 9 would be considered the Director level(s) or the _report to_ , from the GM, also known as Regional Managers in a more traditional sense. Additionally, there seem to be site locations where there are no Senior Ops Managers but only Operations Managers instead. That may or may not be the reasons for those site's GMs to be an L7 instead of an L8.",Positive

fjVnR5c0xZ4,"Tired of the ""automation won't replace humans, but work with them"" nonsense. Entry-level today, mid/late career tomorrow, C-suite the next day. Starting with the great decoupling in the 1970s, human labor has been and will continue trending to zero. Think EXPONENTIALLY, not LINEARLY. Automation and robotics will necessarily replace human workers due to the current economic system. Today, AI is the WORST it will ever be going forward. It DOESN'T MATTER if AI ""creates"" 200 million new jobs...AI will solve and execute these new ""jobs"" much faster than humans will be able to adapt, learn, and fill them. Capital/employee model-it worked great...for quite a while. However, now companies that automate lower their costs, become more competitive. Those that keep higher-cost human labor necessarily fall behind and will go out of business. This creates a system where replacing people with machines is not just likely, but necessary for company survival. There is a way to deal with this humanely, but it would require a full revamp of the social contract and our concept of work. Even capitalists will want this change when unemployment reaches a tipping point and there’s no one left with money to buy the crap they’re selling.

I know, LLMs are leveling off, ""what about the energy?,"" blah, blah, blah. Do not conflate LLMs with AI. LLMs are no more AI than vacuum tubes are computers or AOL dial-up is the internet. So, LLMs are leveling off. History shows technological advance is not just one sigmoid curve. It's a series of sigmoid curves with each successive one reaching new capabilities and new heights. To think that after 200,000 years, this pattern is all the sudden going to stop is absurd. I also understand there will be new jobs for humans created, it will go in this pattern: Automation creates 5 new jobs this year, lays off 30; creates 5 new jobs next year, lays off 500; creates 5 new jobs the following year, lays off 1500 etc. In the macro economic picture, do you not see this as an issue? I also understand there is more opportunity for entrepreneurs. Again, from the macro perspective there is a MINORITY of people that have the entrepreneurial ability/spirit. It takes that, and a strong majority of people don't have it.

Reasoning AI Is the Next Big Leap. The future of AI is not just about generating answers, but about “reasoning” breaking down complex problems step-by-step, more like a human brain. Breakthroughs like DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning models are already being incorporated into platforms like GPT and xAI, marking a shift toward more advanced, thoughtful AI. Think EXPONENTIALLY, not LINEARLY.

There’s a persistent and misleading narrative circulating often perpetuated by short term goal-driven institutions like politicians, universities, and tech company executives, that the future of work is secure. The claim goes: “You just need to learn how to work with AI,” and humans collaborating with AI will outperform either one alone. But recent research, including a landmark study from the University of Virginia, tells a different story. In diagnosing medical conditions, AI alone achieved far greater accuracy than either human doctors or even doctors assisted by AI. The median diagnostic accuracy for the docs using Chat GPT Plus was 76.3%, while the results for the physicians using conventional approaches was 73.7%. Sounds like “a win” at first. However, Chat GPT Plus alone achieved a median diagnostic accuracy of more than 92%. In other words, the comforting idea that humans will always be essential partners to machines is crumbling. In many fields, AI is not just a tool, it is the superior performer. This has staggering implications for the future of work, especially to the often used solution of prior technological displacement that go “You just need to be retrained.” To the group advocating the ""retraining solution,"" I pose to you this: You have a medical doctor, just finished 8 years of higher education, a low-paid 4-year internship/residency, is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and just got outperformed by automation; what would you have this doctor retrained into that will offer a secure job?

The result of this, since the United States' moronic system is based on taxing employees for about 70% of all tax revenue, this will further exacerbate the problem. Tax needs to be based on what's going on now and in the future not what worked 75 years ago. Oh I know it's so evil to think, but we might need to tax the companies who are doing the automation. Even if you do that, it's a win-win. For instance say a company had 1,000 employees in automated away down to 100. 1,000 employees paid federal taxes, including payroll tax, of about 20 million a year. Now the 100 people pay about 2 million a year. However, by automating, the company sees two things: they are no longer paying approximately 60 million in wages and their share of payroll tax, AND since nobody automates to lose money they also have higher profits. What's so wrong about taxing that company for the $60 million dollars they don't have to pay anymore and a fair percentage of their additional profits they now make through the automation. Not all the additional profits, but some of them. If you do that there's a higher tax revenue and more profits for the company. That's a win-win for the government and for businesses. If humanity, as a whole, weren't so stupid, we would just adjust as tech progresses to where EVERYONE benefits somewhat from each stage and just move smoothly into the post-labor economy.

To understand this shift, consider the historical role of the horse and oxen. They were once essential to the economy as sources of power for agriculture, transport, and industry. Technologies like the horse collar and the steel plow dramatically increased their output, making them even more valuable. But then came the steam engine and, later, the internal combustion engine. These machines didn’t just help the horse, but outperformed it entirely. Trains, tractors, and trucks could do the job ten, even a hundred times faster and more powerfully. And from that moment forward, the horse was no longer critical to economic output. It was, in essence, unemployed.

This is what AI and robotics are doing to human labor. They are not simply replacing the repetitive or the physical; they are increasingly outperforming humans in cognition, strategy, design, and communication. And just like the horse, our value in the economic system will diminish, not from lack of talent or effort, but because machines will do the job better. That’s why we need to start thinking not in terms of retraining, but about restructuring society itself for a world where human labor is no longer essential to production. When the very essence of what makes an entity useful to the current economy is superseded (be that strength, endurance, dexterity, analysis, creativity, empathy, intelligence, persuasion as well as many other qualities) that entity becomes irrelevant to economic output.

Potential solution. Decentralized AI Ownership: A Bridge Toward Post-Scarcity. While Universal Basic Income (UBI) may serve as an initial economic stopgap, bridging today’s economy with tomorrow’s abundance consider an even more equitable and long-term solution: Decentralizing the ownership of artificial intelligence itself. 

Rather than concentrating the power of AI in the hands of a few corporations or governments, envision a model where AI entities are open-source and collectively owned. This could take the form of assigning each person a digital ""share"" of an AI system, not unlike a stakeholder’s share in a company. As the AI produces value, whether through intellectual labor, creative output, or autonomous economic participation, those shares would generate dividends distributed directly to individuals. 

This model would ensure that as AI becomes the dominant productive force in society, the wealth it creates is shared universally, not monopolized. It aligns with the principle that the fruits of public knowledge made possible by centuries of human collaboration should benefit everyone, not just a few early adopters or private entities. In practice, this could look like: 

- AI systems running Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that distribute profits algorithmically.
- Smart contracts ensuring transparent, equitable income flows based on collective stake.
- Global “AI cooperatives” where users vote on how AI is used, improved, and deployed.
- Universal basic compute.
 
If AI becomes the primary driver of economic output, then equitable access to its benefits isn’t just fair, it’s necessary to avoid deepening inequality and instability. It provides a scalable, technologically aligned extension to UBI, ensuring people not only have income, but true economic participation in the age of intelligent machines. 

Ultimately, decentralized AI ownership may be the last transition phase before full post-scarcity, when advanced technologies like universal nanofactories or matter compilers render even economic structures obsolete. Until then, however, models like this offer a way to reclaim agency in a world where production no longer requires human hands, and where wealth can, for the first time in history, truly be universal.",Positive

It's like everyone’s just obsessed with numbers, but it doesn’t actually make things better for people.

Here’s an idea: what if there was a global agreement that every employee should get at least 20 days of paid annual leave, excluding weekends and public holidays (like the Christmas shutdown in Western countries)? Some places could offer more if they wanted, but 20 days should be the bare minimum for everyone. Imagine if companies actually valued time off as part of a healthy work-life balance.

And speaking of work culture, why not encourage more 'mediocre' work? Not everything needs to be a race to the top. What if the target was simple—just meet a minimum to get a guaranteed 2% pay rise each year? This could be something easy for most people to achieve, and if you wanted to go above and beyond, you could take on a higher target, but at least the basic expectations wouldn’t feel like they’re crushing everyone.

nj2c5mKGTtQ,"One of the most overlooked reasons great people leave their jobs is a lack of respect and the presence of discriminatory practices. Even when a job offers competitive compensation, growth opportunities, and a decent work-life balance, it cannot retain top talent if employees do not feel valued and respected.  

Disrespect in the workplace can take many forms, from dismissing employees’ ideas and ignoring their contributions to failing to provide a safe and inclusive environment. Discriminatory practices whether overt or subtle create a toxic atmosphere that erodes trust and loyalty. When employees experience or witness bias, exclusion, or favoritism, it chips away at their commitment and morale.  

Top performers want to work where they are seen as equals, where their hard work is recognized fairly, and where they can contribute meaningfully without fear of discrimination. Organizations that fail to prioritize respect and inclusivity ultimately lose the very people who drive their success.  

For companies looking to retain great talent, it’s crucial to cultivate a culture of respect, fairness, and equity. This means actively addressing discrimination, listening to employees’ voices, and fostering an environment where everyone feels safe and valued. Only then can organizations ensure they keep the best people who are not just working for a paycheck but are invested in the mission and values of their workplace.",Positive

At my station in pick, you can't take a bathroom break unless the machines are being worked on or somebody covers you. The rate (after 5 weeks once you get used to it) is something nearly impossible like over 300. I didn't really get higher than 280 going at a pretty quick pace. The main parking lot is so small that I had to park way out in the bigger parking lot so walking in and out is a like 5 minute process. And I would work on the 4th or 5th floor so that means either stairs or wait for the elevator which seems to take forever.
 
The only good things are the pay and the ability to wear comfortable clothing including shorts and t-shirts, and hats. And the instant hire process. Seasonal employees don't even get benefits til after 90 days. The stupid robot machines would keep messing up for me, either getting stuck or not moving the totes. The last straw for me after already starting the day off on a bad note was the totes getting stuck and not moving. I walked out.

-Uwcl9UsO9g,I've been at Amazon for almost 4 years this October the 20th will be my 4 years. And yes the first year or two will kick your ass if you last that long. I worked in cross stock and in   inbound that is where you load a truck and unload a truck. And for the whole bathroom situation The first couple of months I told them. after that I just went to the bathroom I come back to where I was working. yes there is a lot of bull crap that goes on at Amazon.,Positive
-Uwcl9UsO9g,Amazon is slavery bro l. I did delivery for a day and I quit. You have to load your own truck up with product on that cool as loading dock. It was back breaking work. I was so fucking tired after day one it felt like I worked a whole week. I got home and I knew I wasn’t going back,Negative

It will tire you.  Now I work for online grocery company here in Korea where I manage a team of people and I also help out.  18.50 after taxes is less than 30k.  About same as here in Korea but living costs is half and we have universal health care and pension.  It’s not really a livable wage in US but it is here.,Positive

-Uwcl9UsO9g,"Worked at one of their warehouses for a little over a year. Saw many other people leave for better paying less stressful jobs. I didn’t mind the fast pace, it was the low pay. Nothing wrong with being pushed as long you are being compensated much better than the local minimum wage. My pay was just $16.50/hr. The job I did required me to sort items for packing. I was expected to sort 650 an hour, or 5850 over 9 hours during a 10 shift. So obviously many tens of thousands of dollars passing through my hands daily. If I had received a piece rate of 5.64 cents per package my pay would have been doubled. So obviously you’re getting underpaid for the volume and pace of the work.",Positive

-Uwcl9UsO9g,I’ve worked in warehouses for about 5 years. I’ve worked as assembly and material handler and a powder coat painter all shift ranges From 8hrs to 12 hrs a day. I just can’t stand the depressing looping nature of the job wake up and do the same exact thing everyday it gets boring and repetitive. I recently switched to night shift stocking and holy shi it’s so much more free and better for right now and it pays $24 an hour keep your sanity over that bs. They don’t care nothing about you only if you hit the number target for the week or day. And pls don’t cross train because you won’t get paid for it and you will work in numerous areas for the same pay. While some favorite that they have gets to work in the easiest area. And the management is always aholes all of them they want you to kiss ass and hit numbers f that. Stay blessed find what best for you 💯,Positive

-Uwcl9UsO9g,"I worked at an Amazon warehouse for over 5 years. It helped me get credit cards and build up my credit score, get my own apartment, buy a car, pay off tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt. Then I felt like I was a failure bc I had a degree and my family looked down at me for being a warehouse worker. One day I just quit my job at Amazon bc I would start literally crying at the thought of going to work. I only had $5000 saved up. I took out a loan of $27,000 to attend a coding bootcamp (it was called Codesmith = cost of tuition =about $20k and $7k for living expenses). 

They told us if we did exactly as they told us and followed all their instructions, it would take us 3 to 6 months to get a job. 

I did NOT follow their instructions and it ended up taking me 2.5 years to get a job. I went into an embarrassing amount of credit card debt. I finally got a job in the tech sector paying $10 an hour but I leveraged that job to get a better job after 6 months as a software engineer and then got promoted to senior software engineer within 3 months of joining the company (I worked my a$$ off - working 12 hours a day which honestly I was used to from my time at Amazon warehouses and working unpaid overtime all to impress my boss and it worked and I got the promotion).  



However 3 years since I quit my job from an Amazon warehouse I am working as a senior software engineer at a respectable company. 

However bc of the debt I accrued after quitting my warehouse job amazon as a fulfillment associate, I am honestly in a worse financial position even though I make 6 figures now since almost most of my salary goes back to paying my insanely high debts and loans. 

So idk how to feel - my days are a thousand times more stressful but maybe my self respect is higher but now I realize my time working at Amazon as a fulfillment associate was not as bad I thought it was. There can be worse ways to live your life. So yeah - maybe in a year my mind will change but that’s life - you gotta learn to pivot when things aren’t jiving with your heart and soul even if your mind says and thinks the opposite.",Positive
-Uwcl9UsO9g,"All warehouse jobs sucks, I know. Keep your peace and sanity.",Positive
-Uwcl9UsO9g,"That warehouse job was hell plain and simple. I did a month of 10-hour night shifts at Amazon, standing the entire time with barely any breaks. They didn’t even have shoes in my size, so I was forced to wear the wrong ones, and when I got home, my socks were bloody. The work is nonstop, the pressure’s insane, and you’re treated like a machine. Managers talk down to you, and I even got written up for spending 5–7 minutes in the toilet - no joke, I was actually using it. No one’s there by choice; they’re just stuck with no better options. I went and got my CDL right after I quit, and I haven’t looked back since.",Negative

-Uwcl9UsO9g,"i quit my auto parts warehouse job yesterday - posted this to Facebook

So i have been preparing to quit my Job and move on to other things for a long time. Just never made the jump. I been doing the work of at least 2-3 people for a couple years now after corporate bought our local business, cut half the staff in half and made the remaining people there responsible for 2-3 times the work. This seems to be the corporate mentality these days.  My feet have been hurting for over a year now, I was always trying different shoes. Asking to work less, or maybe they should hire 1 more person to help. I had to pick up hundreds of hundreds of car and boat batteries every week,  every day sometimes over 100 batteries in a day.  The last week or 2 my right foot was turning purple and blue and I had to go to urgent care.  Nothing was broken but I had a swollen vein and couldn't work anymore.  I was off for 5 days and they wanted me to come back but I still couldn't put pressure on my foot even though it is healing with treatment and rest. I've been preparing to leave this job for a long time, I have money saved, im good, I've been there 6 years.  I am 100 percent ready to start my new  journey. Just gonna rest and get 100 percent again  before I do. Im letting yall in on this personal stuff in my life becuase this is a decision I was not strong enough to just make on my own, switching jobs like this, but sometimes God makes the decision for you. And puts you in a position with no other choice. I truly believe God has put me through this to get me to move on and make a change in my life I've been too scared to make myself. And thats what im doing. My boss of 6 years, not the corporate manager, is also out with sepsis. Almost died. He is 65 and was being overworked like me, always telling me he was gonna quit and move to the mountains. I didn't find this out till I gave my resignation. And he might be done for good there too. Him and I were very close and he showed me what it's like to work hard and take care of ya family and ill never forget that. So by the Grace of God my last day and his last day were the same. Keep him in your prayers yall and if at least one of yall prays for him this morning that would be 💯 
Again im only sharing this post to share the Grace of God. Love ya guys 🫶🫂🙏

-Uwcl9UsO9g,"I think it just comes right down to, if you don't mind being a robot then you are good. Our fulfillment center is chill asf. Rates? No problem, they seemed impossible at first, but once your body is on automatic mode you can literally chill and you are at or above rate. Bathroom breaks? Yea it depends on what position you are working that period, but usually a manager or neighbor will cover you. On other positions, we can go without saying a word, and not get a word spoken to us for it. Unless you take a 30-45 minute break of course. Also, it really comes down to the type of person you are, I see A LOT of lazy people in there that I know will be gone by the time seasonal is up, or sooner. Then they'll be right back. But if you just do what you are suppose to, which is work, then everything will be good. Very repetitive, which sometimes gets to me as well. But sometimes I like seeing how high I can get my rate and that makes the time go by faster. It really isn't that bad, it's just not for everybody.",Positive

-Uwcl9UsO9g,I quit working for Amazon warehouse after 3 months. Everyone there thinks they’re your boss and they don’t hesitate to threaten you with termination or other types of consequences. I had one lead guy who would immediately call on me when he wanted anything done. He chewed me out for putting a delivery on the floor before it was entered into the system. Then I get injured from a guy pushing a box spring off a stack of them and it landed on my foot and he refused to apologize. The warehouse manager made a rude comment that was rather personal. The other higher ups couldn’t have cared less. Then when it was almost the holiday season we were told that we’d be there until the wee hours of the morning. I’m like *NOPE*,Negative
6p1m2nCE7jE,"These kinds of interviews are so ridiculous.  It's amazing anyone gets a job.  I got asked one time--tell me about a time where you gave someone the wrong information.  What kind of stupid question is that?  Why would I give someone the wrong information?  I just keep researching until I find the right information or give them the best information available at the time and am extremely clear that this is all the information that is currently available.  

Unless people are just out there making stuff up, no one can ever check your answer for it being the truth, so I guess just having a made up story rehearsed is probably the best way to get through the scam interview process.",Negative

6p1m2nCE7jE,"""Tell me about"" ... ?
Does anyone pay attention to the following impact:
1. An event 
2. A pattern (mastery)
3. An underlying structure (culture)
4. A vision (leadership)
5. A mindset (research logic, thinking skills: system, critical, lateral, disruptive, question, inversion, scenarios/evolution, etc)
6. Spiritual experience (something extraordinary/divine) happened.

Instead of STAR try (I)SBAR (Ask the interviewer, too):
I-Issue/Challenge
S-Situation, facts only
B-Background/Context
A-Assessment
R-Recommendation
Execution is another matter. 

Results in STAR should be further probed with R.O.I.:
R-Immediate ""R""esult
O-""O""utcome, what change had to be made to support ""R""
I-Long term ""I""mpact

For example, two technicians plus an engineer resigned. After a ""small"" change I made, for the next two years (until the end of my employment),  the company never employed those three roles. Was it a small change? If I did nothing else, until I left, the change covered the cost of all my salaries and much more?  

In your interview, ask Amazon: How have you got rid of ""I am right you are wrong"" paradigm? (How) Do you practice Lateral/Disruptive Thinking? What have you learned?",Negative

Leaders isolate, glass ceil, cheat within the org to advance their cause and carreer at the cost of other employees. They know how to exploit direct reports and get work done by any means. 
There are many leaders who do this and recommend others to go on corporate training on ethical behavior, unconscious bias and show/pretend to be champions of diversity and cultural promotion.

However, they still failed their interviews, not because they are incapable of doing the job, but because they don't know how to effectively sell themselves to others. Final Round AI is here to help, we are all about delivering tailored answers in real-time to help you nail those interviews.",Positive
6p1m2nCE7jE,So many leadership principal still Amazon Prime Videos works like shit,Negative

6p1m2nCE7jE,"To me it feels like they are more interested in one's personal ability to invent stories and being creative about it. I've been asked to prepare 2-3 examples for each of the 16 leadership principles, which is an insanely huge amount of things to tell. How many decades of experience do I need for the job position!? And what a great memory I need to have to be able to tell this many stories and examples over so many different topics! It feels overwhelming. I'm trying to get prepared as best as I can, but it feels like what you are asking for is not very well connected to what is needed for the actual job I've applied for. 5 interviews with 5 different interviewers, and I need to provide them all with different examples... Isn't this a bit too much?",Positive
6p1m2nCE7jE,"Bullsh*t interview. I'm sure that some people can lie a lot answering these stupid questions. They make sense for a product manager or any kind of managers, but for an SDE position, it's just too much focus on leadership principles.",Negative

Don't repeat stories can be tricky. 
Not everyone's a storyteller. This isn't Antiquity or Medieval times. We have technology now so storytelling is a little different from what it used to be so storytelling is a skill that many may have to work on.

Also, having experience to certain situations shouldn't be a detriment into your hiring. So that's also tricky.",Negative
6p1m2nCE7jE,"Nicely done video, but I'm not sure I'd want to work someplace that expects people to memorize the leadership principles as if it's some kind of religion. Are they hiring robots or people??",Negative
6p1m2nCE7jE,"For lots of these ""tell me about a time "" you have the same general area of interest :  tell me about a time you had conflict with team members,  tell me about a time that you had to convince team members(which is due to conflict)  and more -- during the interview the candidate tries to have 5,6 stories aligned with these questions and if two different interviewer ask the above  questions then obviously I have to stick with my storyline  -- If i try to think of something new during the interview there is a high chance of extra stress and probably not a good result at the end... I just think 5 hours of these type of questions is unnecessary  .",Negative
6p1m2nCE7jE,"Amazon leadership principles and sample questions:
1- Customer obsession: tell me about a time you had a deal with a difficult customer.

A5u1xZwClvU,"Well, the Amazon warehouse I work at is very good at ensuring employees are safe. But, I guess some of the Amazon warehouses had management that wasn't concerned about employees well-being. 

This explains why the Amazon device sometimes asks employess how likely we are to stop working if a co-worker is injured or ar serious risk of injury? I thought it was OBVIOUS that ANYONE woild dtop working if their co-worker was in serious danger if they continued working. I guess not.",Negative
A5u1xZwClvU,It happened to my warehouse as well and the managers were silent as well. But the employees and APs were not,Positive
A5u1xZwClvU,I work at Amazon. If you sick and get a doctor note saying you’re ill and unable to work you can go out on medical leave even if you don’t have UPT.  This worker should have been told that so he didn’t have to stay at work in fear of losing his job.,Negative

A5u1xZwClvU,"They give out gushers, and sweet treats like their workers are a bunch of kids instead of raises, gift cards, anything financially helpful which they CAN afford, it’s what everyone wants but Amazon won’t do it. You’d be lucky to get a .25 raise every year, and during harsh weather conditions they expect you to come to work even through a fucking tornado, I know this because one of my friends died he was forced to go to work and the warehouse collapsed during a tornado. they act like safety is their #1 to avoid lawsuits, but in reality, those $10 slippers are valued more than your life here at Amazon. A few people died on the freeways due to bad weather, the highways closed because of blizzards, they expect you to drive through all that no matter what. Facts!! No holiday pay, no overtime, they actually try their damndest to cut your hours so you’ll be lucky if you get 30 hours a week, your never appreciated from Amazon or through your dsp, they say good job as a team but will specifically point out how horrible your doing individually. I commend anyone, if you like being treated with respect, Amazon can’t deliver that to you. Don’t work for them watch them burn",Positive

If you are not well, if you are depressed at work, if you are in pain and need to rest - go home.

Companies like Amazon bet on there being someone to replace you; don’t work there.

I worked as a driver for about 2 years for Amazon - I quit because I knew I was going to drive myself into a tree one day: I was so depressed with how I was treated and how little control over my job I had.

Just quit.

Leave.

Go home.

Find a better job with people who value you as a person, not as a number.

Take away the power these companies have by quitting.

They don’t treat you like you’re a human with feelings and dreams?

Don’t help them out.

Quit.

Find a better job.

The FMLA is administered by the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor. The FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to care for a new child, care for a seriously ill family member, or recover from a serious illness.

People make decisions around going home and losing their jobs vs continuing to work while not feeling well all the time. That's what it's like to be an hourly worker in the US. 

It's sad that people die due to this, but it's not just Amazon. Walmart, Sam's Club, BJs, TJMaxx, manufacturing companies, warehouse companies, etc have these same issues where someone can get let go for leaving work sick without having UPTO time. Some even keep a score of how many times you were out unscheduled and if you reach a certain score you get fired, no matter if you have a doctor's note.

He finally staggered out and went to work, a long commute by light rail and shuttle bus, and started to work his shift but felt so bad that he found his supervisor and told him he was too sick to work. His supervisor sent him to the warehouse nurse’s office, where they looked him over and agreed he was too sick to work.

She was getting electrocuted the entire time she was sorting the bin and that was why she was having such intense chest pain.

There's lots of circumstances that occur that make it hard or even impossible to make 200 stops per day and 20 stops per hour such as traffic jams, detours, rainy conditions, delivering several packages to apartment complexes, customers asking questions about packages, etc.  Many amazon delivery drivers urinate in cups on the side of the road due to fearing that if they stop somewhere to use the bathroom, they won't be able to make 200 stops per day and 20 stops per hour.

I don’t blame you for not wanting to do it, though, cause everything you said is true. I’ve seen it all and then some…businesses, garden apartments with no elevators and 4 floors, dogs, etc. My body is still paying for it now (thankfully retired now).

I think it was 13 minutes to load up.

Difference in mail carriers, UPS, etc. is those companies have more respect for their workers. To Amazon, employees are a necessary evil.

The warehouse seems worse. They turned over people just as fast as DSPs.

Good video. Hope you’re doing well now. 👊🏾",Positive

You are a lazy motherfucker seriously

But I'm not gonna knock you too hard.It could be you had a bad employer.Because some d s p's are absolute shit But again, I can't do a layup if I practiced for a 100 hours, I probably could it's the same thing.I really haven't changed anything i've done since i've started working here but i've just gotten faster and better at it because i've done it so much",Negative

I did the ride along route then the next day I did my first route on my own with 152 stops.. The camera said distracted driver as I reached for my water bottle so I punched it so hard that it was dangling in the air.. I wanted to be done then, the DSP said you're 15-20 deliveries ahead of schedule don't give up.. It was hush hush between him and I about the camera situation and I guess I was the first person that ever did such a thing haha.. So the next day I gave it another try, well yesterday around 6ish I called the DSP and said I am done with this so someone came out and grabbed the remaining 4 totes left.. It felt like such a lonely boring job, I didn't even find time to take a leak, so I did pee in a bottle in the back of the van knowing I couldn't hold it anymore 😅 ... Probably would of been great if I had country routes but in a city and no spots to park or turn around nahhh hell no not for $21.25 an hour...

1) never work a job with quotas: quotas are slavery, they ONLY benefit the company at your economic and bodily loss. they bring stress every day for the life of the job.

2) dont work for 2nd party or 3rd or whatever. you will get slave drive. the money is at amazon not the 2nd party employer. amazon is afraid of unionisation and propper pay. any workers they can shed off their direct payroll is their strategy. well, make them pay what is propper.

So i have been preparing to quit my Job and move on to other things for a long time. Just never made the jump. I been doing the work of at least 2-3 people for a couple years now after corporate bought our local business, cut half the staff in half and made the remaining people there responsible for 2-3 times the work. This seems to be the corporate mentality these days.  My feet have been hurting for over a year now, I was always trying different shoes. Asking to work less, or maybe they should hire 1 more person to help. I had to pick up hundreds of hundreds of car and boat batteries every week,  every day sometimes over 100 batteries in a day.  The last week or 2 my right foot was turning purple and blue and I had to go to urgent care.  Nothing was broken but I had a swollen vein and couldn't work anymore.  I was off for 5 days and they wanted me to come back but I still couldn't put pressure on my foot even though it is healing with treatment and rest. I've been preparing to leave this job for a long time, I have money saved, im good, I've been there 6 years.  I am 100 percent ready to start my new  journey. Just gonna rest and get 100 percent again  before I do. Im letting yall in on this personal stuff in my life becuase this is a decision I was not strong enough to just make on my own, switching jobs like this, but sometimes God makes the decision for you. And puts you in a position with no other choice. I truly believe God has put me through this to get me to move on and make a change in my life I've been too scared to make myself. And thats what im doing. My boss of 6 years, not the corporate manager, is also out with sepsis. Almost died. He is 65 and was being overworked like me, always telling me he was gonna quit and move to the mountains. I didn't find this out till I gave my resignation. And he might be done for good there too. Him and I were very close and he showed me what it's like to work hard and take care of ya family and ill never forget that. So by the Grace of God my last day and his last day were the same. Keep him in your prayers yall and if at least one of yall prays for him this morning that would be 💯 
Again im only sharing this post to share the Grace of God. Love ya guys 🫶🫂🙏

This job should be used ideally as a stepping stone to help you get funds for the next chapter of your life, whether it's hitting the trades or starting up your own business. That's not to say it's the worst job to work for the rest of your life but, it's a dead end job where you stay at $21.25 an hour. I've worked construction at 17, 18, 19, 20 years old. Concrete laborer & masonry laborer. Amazon delivery comes NOTHING close, NOTHING near how hard and labor intensive construction is. When I hear people cry about Amazon it just makes me laugh.

HyMo7vBE1IQ,I use to think of working at Amazon like being a taxi driver whose meter is always running. The timer is always running and employees are required to keep up with it. It’s definitely a time crunch environment. No time to goof off or talk with friends except for break or lunch time.,Positive

HyMo7vBE1IQ,"tbh, I don't like being a monkey repeater, but more likely being a thinker who can find solutions.. that's why I went for AWS interviews after working for other big techs. I want to innovate and come up with better solutions, I don't wanna be just another gear rolling with the flow.

HyMo7vBE1IQ,"Please don't get me wrong for saying this, but I have seen so many people with the title ""former amazon"" that I have doubts if amazon is really such a good place or if people just stay there for a while to be able to move to another company with higher salary, the latter seems to be the case. The latest example is a Solutions Architect for AWS that I was following in youtube and it did not take 2 years for him to leave. Today was my interview for such role but after so many negative feedback on Amazon I read just today I got fairly unmotivated (at least for today) .... there's gotta be a very good reason for so many people quitting so early.",Positive

Pyrp2LXpYSo,"Worst part about outbound pick is if its slow you run the chance of them making you tote run. Just pushing a cart with yellow totes up and down one side of the floor restocking the machines. It’s a good day if they send you to inventory count. Much lower performance metrics and managers don’t bother you, super chill. Told my manger I’m getting burned out tote running all the time and wanted to cross train but told there was no slots open right now.

sJaFqiMfyM0,I quit a toxic job. Took 15 months to get another job. Sad but worth it. The manager drove out all 9 subordinates within a year. He was eventually fired for it but it was too late for me.,Negative

""I didn't see this posted yesterday."" 
or
""The Marketing team needs to do more""

For clarity, I was the social media manager and was working my ass off trying to get everything they wanted done. The ""I didn't see this post"" usually referred to an IG story that I posted and you know stories disappear after 24 hours. It was frustrating.",Negative

sJaFqiMfyM0,I work in a toxic environment where the nepotism is blatant. People with little to no experience are promoted to the highest paying jobs just because they know or are related to the c-suite executives.,Positive
sJaFqiMfyM0,"I gave my notice today, very politely and am pretty proud of the ""No drama, just some personal things I need to take care of"". Nobody can question that without risking hearing about bowel issues, kidney stones, death of oldest friend/pet/beloved cousin....
Also, make at least one intentional silly mistake, get the day/date wrong, that kind of thing something minor just in speech, it'll give them something to gossip and feel superior about :)
It's taken me so many vile jobs to finally understand the mindsets of the people there....If I can leave on good terms with them able to give me a reference for at least being a nice person, that's all I ask, as without references you cannot get a non-toxic job.",Positive
sJaFqiMfyM0,I'm glad I left. Doctor said I didn't see a difference between living on the edge for last 8 years and normal life. 1.5h year of mental health therapy after getting ptsd because of my previous job :3 Still coping,Positive
sJaFqiMfyM0,"8:55 This makes a lot of sense, that managers who don’t know how to manage difficult people will instead manage the manageable people even harder. That’s exactly what happened in my previous job. Managers would make huge deals and hyper inflate any tiny mistake I ever made (or even told me off for things I didn’t even do!), while completely ignoring huge problems that the toxic coworkers were causing with all their bullying. It was ridiculously frustrating how the rude people were treated the best, while the nice people like myself were treated the worst and walked all over! I asked my mom what she thought about why my coworkers were so beyond rude to me for no reason, yet so overly nice to the rude people (who were literally rude to everyone). I thought if anything, they should hate on the people who are actually rude to them! And I’ll never forget what my mom said: “That’s because they’re intimidated by the rude people.”",Negative
sJaFqiMfyM0,"Worked in a team that didn't believe I deserved the promotion as I was newer than others. They resented my hard work and great work ethnics as it made them look bad. They resented my manager seeing through that and accused him of favouritism towards me. So they all acted up and made my role as team leader impossible. They did not listen to any directions, instead challenged everything I said and criticised everything I wrote no matter how small or even if the same wording was used by a a general manager. As the words that came from me  became unacceptable. They made out that I was the problem, not them and their unwillingness to work or do their job. Eventually they left one by one until I had enough of the toxicity and couldn't handle it affecting my personal life. When I did leave after 2.5 years, the mastermind was taking work cover as working with me caused her too much stress. Working in the same building or having me say her name in a meeting or receiving an email from me induced an anxiety attack. This was all a scheme and drama that she created to get paid doing nothing from home for a year. When she finally came back she refused to join the team in the same building saying it was too stressful for her yet she complained about not being able to connect with the team. HR finally caught onto her fabrication and through many more months was able to get rid of her. What a waste if everyone's time and the company's resources. Dealing with entitled and lazy people at work who want to take the credit and happy to criticise anyone else who performs better is shameful and disgusting",Negative
sJaFqiMfyM0,"My comment disappeared- here it is again: all lower case since everyone is sensitive to Upper Case letters. Corporate Alert 🚨 Human Resources in any type of company is not humane. It should be called Corporate Services and they are there for the company’s best interests at all costs. Do not be fooled into thinking that Human Resources is a resource for the employees- it is solely for the employer. Trust no one but yourself, truly. Your coworkers are not really your friends they are your coworkers and that is it. It’s all survival in the workplace and those very same coworkers will try to find an edge over you and find your weaknesses and then exploit your weaknesses and will spread rumours about you which ultimately will ruin your livelihood and then you have no job. Be aware Be Careful Be Diligent with protecting yourself in the workplace. I worked for the municipal level government in my province for 20 years of my life. 2017 I was fired. Was it all my fault, no. Could I have done things differently….💯 but I got “got” and it was too late. ⏰ BUT Please don’t let others tell you what you are capable of doing and not doing. Advocate for yourself because no one else will do it. Toxic workplaces are everywhere and you can do your part by being smart cautious and by not Adding to the workplace toxicity. Thank you. Let’s see if this comment stays here long.",Negative
sJaFqiMfyM0,"Great list. The biggest mistake people make in toxic jobs is trying to “win” by explaining more.

sJaFqiMfyM0,Some of my male coworkers brought their strategic incompetence to the job to make the others do the majority of their work. Or they just do the parts they want and leave the majority to the others. You have no other choice but to do it or get the trouble the lazy bum deserved. Complaining or looking for help from the higher pay grades just results in you getting bullied and gaslit. It stopped being fun a long time ago.,Negative
sJaFqiMfyM0,"This is so true!! I was doing EXACTLY this with my Jekyll-and-Hyde, toxic (bat-shit crazy) boss. It made it so much worse, and I didn't understand why.

sJaFqiMfyM0,I went to work for a construction company out of Virginia. I'm over 50 years old. I was taught to work and work hard. I did twice the work of people half my age.

sJaFqiMfyM0,"I worked at this place a few years ago. The place was very cliquey. I wanted to move up after earning my degree. They did not just overlook me for an internal position I applied to, they gave me a write-up of things they had to actively find to defame me. I applied to another internal position. The unqualified HR girl with no degree came by my desk, and she said I could not apply to any position for 6 months, because I had a write-up recently. I looked at the employee handbook, and I could not find anything supporting what she said. However, they gave the position to the new person who had only been there for less than a month. The employee handbook does say that employees have to wait 6 months before transfering to a new position. They just pick and choose, or make up rules when they need them. I felt as they were stopping me from soaring by clipping my wings. That day, I noticed how narcissistic people can be and developed cynicism. I took the first job that came; however, it was an even worse job. A series of events happened at that job, and I left it too. Today, I work at a healthy workplace. I am still recovering mentally from those past jobs. There needs to be more awareness of narcissist at the workplace, and actual help with them. I should not have to deal with antagonists who like to step over people, because of some sort of trauma they've yet to overcome.",Negative

My thought process was ""well it's easy so maybe this will get me promoted.""

sJaFqiMfyM0,"A toxic work environment equals out to exactly the same as mental and emotional abuse. Why is this acceptable in so many places??? This is what I'm dealing with right now. My supervisor and co-workers make me feel like I'm the one with the problem. Yeah, I have a problem with certain people being able to have the freedom to have their choice of what job they want to do or not do, or even if they wanna do anything at all and just sit around and stare at the wall all day while I'm the only one doing any work and getting the shit end of the stick of everything. It's abuse. And if you don't click with them, they will abuse you as much as they can. It's sick that supervisors and other people are allowed to get away with this behavior. Back in the 90s it was worse and people expected you to keep your mouth shut and deal with it. Well why should people keep their mouth shut and deal with it these days??? Abuse and bullying goes much further than childhood or school incidences. It's a form of bullying and abuse. And I have enough respect for myself to know I don't deserve to be treated that way.",Negative
sJaFqiMfyM0,"I'm in a toxic work environment right now. I deal with it by constantly asking for clarity, especially when I'm being lied to. I use the socratic method of repeating back the previous statement to see if my boss will repeat it or change the subject, she always changes the subject, especially when she's lying. 

When I hear feedback supposedly from others about something I said or did, I ask the who, what, where, when questions and say that I want to clarify what I'm being told wasn't taken out of context. Guess what? My boss deflects and tries to blame me or changes the subject. 

I send follow up emails or respond to emails after meetings and will copy my notes or respond to statements made by my boss that were untrue. I always cc HR in my correspondence with this individual. There now has to be a third party in our meetings due to her lying and trying to misrepresent what I say. Needless to say, these meetings have gotten much shorter, even though I'm the only one on the team who is being called into the office every Monday for a One-on-one and being micromanaged.

Now I'm going to have conversation with HR, and I'm scared if I will get fired or put in pressure to going back to same office without resolution of any issue. I have 3 request for coming back. And will not be present in that office when I complete daily tasks. Not put high expectations to HR and managers will resolve anything much.

Workplaces like this can quickly turn into a high profile human rights complaint with the external human rights commission if there is one in your area.  This is another reason why so many people are looking for organizations that have Trade Unions they are professionally employment lawyers and know the employment laws in your organization, however sometimes incompetent managers fire people for no valid reason, which then it goes to the trade union representatives to work for you, if they cannot help you you just better look for a employment lawyer in your community.

Also these were the things he had recognized as Exceeds earlier, but under the influence of my sabotaging senior colleague he is calling them as just met. It is astonishing how they expect senior level work from me without compensating me for delivering senior level work? Why is the expectation that I deliver senior level work at a junior title with junior level compensation? And this is coming in at performance review. I was hoping exceeding would get me the recognition I deserved (the promised promotion he never gave and kept telling me will give). He ended it with, ""You should be proud of your accomplishments.

The expectations skyrocketed. 
The workload was impossible. 
It was also always “unacceptable” whenever the plate spinning trick failed. I couldn’t keep it going, but I set myself up for major burnout, simply by doing whatever I was told. 

Task upon task upon task was piled up on me. 

My work was then scrutinized. 

It got to the place where I was personally cleaning out and detailing my manager’s and his son’s cars. I was climbing up on the roof to repair shingles. I was doing everything that was beneath my manager to do. 

I would get an email from my manager saying he was tired of seeing a certain dandelion weed when he would walk from his car to the office. He told me to go out and pull it. 

I would get an email from my manager telling me that if I see the trash full I should empty it because this is a team. He even told me to push the bathroom trash down with  the toilet plunger to save on trash bags. Also he was personally unable to perform any of these tasks. It was beneath him. I was beneath him.

sJaFqiMfyM0,"My first job out of college flipped the script on me my first day working full time a few weeks ago. I worked part time at this office throughout the summer and part time at a restaurant. MY FIRST DAY being full time at the office they said ""Hey we don't have enough resources to support the role you we're hired on for originally, could you do this completely unrelated role part time on Mondays and Tuesdays instead? It will be for no more than 6 months and we think you'll like it more!""   The wanted me to start this new role the following Monday. 


Um yeah, no.

 The owner came up to me and asked me so casually and I originally told them yes and they probably thought to themselves ""What is she going to say, no? This is her only job now."" The role they wanted me to do was the entire reason I pushed myself to go to and finish school; I had been in that role before in the past and I HATED IT. So, after a week of thinking things over and crying my eyes out about it to friends and family, I told my boss in writing that I could not accept the new role/position but that I will stay on for the role that I was originally hired for. We spoke about it in person the following day., I was very diplomatic, mature, and respectful about what I wanted to convey and why I had changed my mind. I just knew it wasn't the right role for me. 

While my boss was respectful and did listen to me, he also tried to make me feel guilty about not filling this role they desperately needed help with. He tried to belittle me by telling me I am not a team player for doing this to them and how another colleague who worked for them in the past and had the same education as me, did what this role for them when asked with no qualms. Well, good for her but I am not her and this is new position is not what I wanted at all. So, I politely told them if I was getting fired from my original role that I would grab my things from my room and leave, if not I would see them Wednesday morning. He didn't fire me and I didn't quit. I ended up getting a call the next day form him and after he spoke with his wife, (co-owner) about it they decided to let me go. All because I honored my feelings and stood up for myself.


I was praised for the work I did in my original role by patients at this office and by my other colleagues. I asked if I was being let go from that position, how did I underperform? They never scolded me for my performance and capability in my original role.  They didn't give me any feedback or response when I asked them how I underperformed in my role there.

My work got an award and recognized in the cooperation level (it was an international company). I liked what I did, and felt good and safe. I bought a house, 11 mins away from the company. 1 month after I bought the house, I was told the team was going to relocate to a different city, because the management was dreaming big about future (their future). I, as the main contributor has no choice but to relocate but others have the choice of working remotely. 
It was all of a sudden, and I had no preparation. I was so convinced about my performance and the job security until I realized everything can happen. Since that day, my attitude towards work completely changed. I no longer think in the position of the company or the team. I think of myself. I do things that help my own growth, finding excuses to not do things that irrelevant to my career goals. I care no more what the team wants to do, and prepare for any moment that the job is gone.
Did I relocate? Of course not. Did the management big dream come true? Of course not. The milestone was only half met with no client in the next two years.

So I was a navigational cadet on merchant vessel when I was 18. My first voyage was a nightmare.

Overall, I felt quite bad, hated it, but decided, that I must be strong and keep on with this job. Ten years later, I left this job, still hating it, though being moderately successful. 
Now, I am working as web dev and enjoying every minute. And I really wish, i realized it much earlier. So yeah, sometimes it’s much better to leave the job you hate, and look for something you actually enjoy.

That's really common actually. They also will pick up food that fell on the floor and put it back on the plate. I've seen a lot of things working in restaurants that are really gross. The worst of which are reusing napkins that customers leave behind, using them to drain oil from stuff coming out of the fryer. Or simply rinsing out a large tub full of raw chicken to be used the next day for chopped vegetables. Or cutting raw chicken on a cutting board then using that same cutting board for cutting vegetables or other food. Apparently cooking most of the food (i.e. stuff that was contaminated by raw chicken) is what keeps these businesses from getting bombed with bad reviews for food poisoning, but just the ""idea"" of what they're doing is extremely disgusting that I would never eat there.",Negative

I think the manager was probably meaning something more like ""try not to just go straight to asking a ton of questions, exhaust your other options first and make yourself better and more familiar with the company's internal structure, then ask questions if you still can't move forward"". It's not the mentality for everyone though, it's tough to handle, but you end up with very autonomous, effective, and efficient culture who has also bonded through the struggle (just like boot camp in the military).

So that's why I own a Bible, read it occasionally and follow scholars a bit online. To me Jeebus was a Jewish preacher who preached the coming of God's Kingdom on earth IN HIS LIFETIME - love thy neighbor, repent and receive the good news. He may have been a bit grandiose and claimed to be the Messiah. In Luke he promised dominion over the 12 tribes of Israel to his disciples - twelve almost totally if not totally illiterate nobodies from Galillee. Did that make sense? In the three synoptic Gospels, he doesn't once claim to be God. Did he work miracles? Sure I guess. But so did other prophets. The apostle Paul is a whole 'nother story. I don't care what your religion is as long as you don't hurt nobody but it's all hooey to me (ever really try to read Revelation?), an outmoded way of dealing with reality.

xP5nOMNku6w,"Eh, I disagree that ""the more challenging a situation you go through, the better you will be at life"". I suppose it depends on what you mean by ""challenging"", but I hear you saying that the more difficult a situation you go through, the better you will be (because you seem to be talking about Amazon's work culture).

There are definitely difficult situations that cause you to grow and become stronger and better. But there are also ones that do nothing but drain and weaken and damage you and leave you *less* able to prosper afterwards. 

For instance, a lot of people who go to war don't emerge from it ""stronger"" -- a lot of them emerge with terrible injuries or health issues and with psychological trauma that cripples their ability to function in civilian society.

I think it's important to recognize a distinction between a ""challenging"" situation, where it's difficult but there is the potential to overcome if you grow and become strong, and a ""corrosive"" or ""toxic"" situation, where no matter how good you become it will still suck and will only drag you down and diminish you. People should embrace challenging situations, but they should *not* tolerate corrosive or toxic situations. And in my experience most companies are more corrosive and toxic than challenging in this sense. Especially the ones that try to spin their toxicity as ""hardcore"" or whatever.

I think these things can be individual, however -- like, one person may experience a situation as toxic whereas another may experience it as challenging, depending on a bunch of factors. Hell, the same person may experience the same situation differently at different points in their life.

But if you are in a toxic situation, I don't think there is a benefit to staying there. I don't think it makes you stronger or better -- quite the opposite, in fact. If something is making you weaker, why would you do it (unless you've specifically resolved to make that sacrifice for family or something)? Definitely give it a minute before deciding....but if a job is stressful and leaves you feeling like shit every day and that doesn't change or at least start to subside in a reasonable time, don't continue at that job any longer than you absolutely have to. Because it does not serve society or individuals to condition people to endure abuse or look at employer abuse as ""challenge"".",Negative

I was a Quality Control tech that just was good at what I did.

We got bought out by Ingram Micro, which is a Fortune 100 company.

​Subject: System Barriers and Productivity Stress During Peak
​It is incredibly frustrating to experience ongoing productivity dips that are clearly caused by system or equipment failures, like the persistent scanner issues at sortside 24 C rebin. We, the associates, are held to increasingly intense rate standards, especially during high-pressure times like the run-up to Cyber Monday at facilities like FAT1. When our work is directly hindered by factors completely out of our control—a faulty scanner, a frozen wall, or slow induct flow in AFE1—it feels demoralizing and unfair. This situation forces associates to push harder to maintain an impossible rate, which only increases stress and can lead to burnout. We need reliable equipment and prompt maintenance to meet goals and ensure our productivity records accurately reflect our effort, not technical barriers. A smoother week, free of these systemic barriers, is essential as we enter the holiday peak.

First of all, as a low income senior, I don't own a vehicle so it's the convenience factor. Second, I live in a small rural area so I'm very limited as per the variety of goods I can find locally.

xNaqrXmsQZo,"They have a thing called ""scan to scan"" when you go on paid break portion your last scanned item before break and first scan item after break has to be less or equal to your break time.  So a 30 minute break is not a real 30 minute break and these Amazon warehouses are the size of a school university like 5 story building so just walking to break room or to your car takes several minutes.  I got a ear full on my first day for having 5 MINUTES of TOT (time off tasks) and was told this is my first warning and if it happens again it may lead to termination...ON MY FIRST DAY!  They do allow 3 minutes grace of TOT but if you make it a habit they will have a talk with you too.

Everyone there was absolutely miserable because the owner sucked the fun out of working there. Not a nice person at all. Never acknowledged me and only communicated through yelling. He yelled at other staff as well and had a very ""my opinion is the only opinion that matters"" personality. He was very rude, and never made the place of business a positive culture. Just always the mentality of ""I pay your salary I am your god"" which is gross and not a good leadership trait.

They don't have enough people they say fuck it and crank up the speed of the lines and work you till you are actually bleeding from smacking body parts of their totes, conveyor, carts etc.... all while coming to you giving you shit because shit isn't going out as fast as they would like. The product you order is stuffed with other random shit. You order a bag of skittles its jammed in a cardboard bin with motor oil and bleach cleaning products. Stuffed so much that often the cleaning products will break open and get all over everything else in the bin. Do they care.... nope!

SWE for amazon get many perks, such as working with bright and polite individuals, beautiful offices, healthcare, and of course amazing pay.

Is enduring the world of Big Tech worth the squeeze? With the mediocre salary I'm getting now, I simply can't afford to progress (buy property, go on regular vacations, etc.) in my HCOL area. But my self doubt is telling me, ""Am I even capable of lasting more than a year without getting PIP'd?"".

I'm looking at Amazon right now simply because I have evidence that I can make it past the interview process in the form of my coworkers who have the same experience.

xNaqrXmsQZo,"Current Amazon employee here (for the rest of January at least)
Hoping this reaches someone thinking of working for amazon or already works there and helps them out.

First of all this is a great video that puts the mental aspect of the job into perspective and i appreciate you put the time and effort into making and putting this out.

Second i been an on and off employee since about 2015-2016. 
Only reason i would keep going back is bc of how easy it is to get hired. I used to be a huge pothead and the mouth swab test was easy enough to pass with only a 1-3 day tolerance break.
Also for those that say theres never any openings, Amazon's turnover rate is stupid high + their positions are in high demand, probably because of reasons previously stated. Meaning multiple spots can be dropped AND snatched up within the same hour.. sometimes minute. Crazy to hear, but yeah I've checked their hiring page multiple times a day, saw literally nothing the first 20 times i checked, randomly see 10 spots in locations all around me the 21st check, and then refreshed the page and they would all be gone.
This is coming from someone thats worked at, at least 5-6 different amazon buildings. Either resigned, or terminated for going negative on hours. Nothing too serious.

Now im back at Amazon, started at an XL delivery station and met a friend that told me to apply for TOM team. Finally got in after a couple months of applying, started training, and worked for a couple months before they started preparing me for CDL school, 100% paid for.
Been on Tom team for a little over 2 yrs now and just put in my 2 weeks to go work for another company.

Anyways, all that to say any L1 position in amazon SUCKS
L3 PA too from what I've heard. 
But under the right mindset, can be one of your best stepping stones available. 
If you can tough it out long enough to get your benefits, or be blessed enough to work at a building that starts you out as a blue badge employee, please utilize career choice or start applying for TOM team if you don't hate the idea of driving tractor-trailers. TOM team is like a whole different section of amazon. Managers actually have your back and the teams are always close and helpful. The work is busy sometimes, but for the most part, management is understanding and willing to partner with you for anything youre going through.
That being said, i still see it as a stepping stone. Got my CDL, got my experience, and now going to make more money with a better schedule. Leaving with no hard feelings for once! I thank amazon this time and appreciate what its done for me.
I dont wanna sound like a simper by any means, but there's ways to work around the system developed by the higher ups and get outta there before you feel stuck!

Also i know I've said under the right mindset L1 positions can be an amazing stepping stone, but i do wanna say to avoid all delivery stations like the plague. They'll work you to the bone and then feed those bones to the yard dogs. 
FCs, SCs, etc are the way to go.

You *DO NOT KNOW* what each person requires financially in their lives, let alone where they live in the country, let alone the world. *YOU DO NOT KNOW* what their circumstances currently are in their lives.

“Good pay” as y’all say may not be “Good pay” to the person standing next to you.

I started at 20$ and they teased us with a rumor of getting 27$ gave us a dollar raise instead then added more shit to our workload. New AI tech bullshit that keeps us out even longer at night. They watch you and just added an app that you have to sign in to listen to you in the van. Very controlling. No benefits. They write you up for everything. Slash your hours whenever they feel like it through forcefully making you take VTO.

znAQ5nBPhWw,Have to run practically to deliver packages and i chased by a german shepherd after disturbing its daily piss to its water bowl. Besides moving fast/hard some days and the dogs it can be an ok job but i say better to go do something else or work in warehouse which aint no better.,Positive
znAQ5nBPhWw,My dsp pays 26.50 and the most I’ve seen on my screen was 260 but it was because 25% of the houses had 5-10 packages. But for my route it’s a 1.5-2hr drive out to the route and it’s a tourist spot and it’s 1 way both ways so traffic is what you’re stuck in for most of your shift 😂,Positive
znAQ5nBPhWw,ALL DSPs are required by Amazon to offer insurance (health and Workers Comp). You can only work 6 days a week MAX.  $21.50/hour and have a flex schedule sounds pretty good.,Positive

znAQ5nBPhWw,"Do the math. 
4 days for 40+ hours/ week.  
That's 160 hours in 8 days vs. 10, so you're already winning there.

Reg pay: $178. OT pay: $66.75
Total daily pay: $244.75. 
Total weekly pay: $979
Total yearly pay: $50, 908.
Your taxes are subjective. 

But the point is, with 52 extra days off, plus great benefits, and very little human interaction, $50k/year is decent and definitely NOT a bad gig. 

Now, the best part is that you can add an extra $12k to your salary by simply adding an extra day, which is ALWAYS AVALIABLE. In which case $63k/year is solid in most areas. 

(6 days /week = $76k/year)",Positive

odqH3LZCahw,"I can only speak for where I work. I work at a sortation center and it really isn't that bad. The work is easy and most associates are lazy, spending more than an hour of their shift talking or waiting for the bathroom to be available for their 4th trip to the bathroom on a 4 hour shift. No one gets fired for lack of productivity and most ppl avoid heavy lifting, so there's not much opportunity for injury.

Most injuries are the result of associate incompetence. Lifting the wrong way after being shown dozens of video demonstrations on how to lift safely. Pellets falling over because ppl don't make any attempt to stack boxes properly. 

I can say that they don't pay me and a handful of other workers enough, but that's because we actually work at work. A lot of ppl spend most of their time socializing and to be honest, they are getting paid more than they deserve.

I created lot of software and drivers, I fixed bugs of any kind for years. However, I was forced against my will to do oncall turns day and night for one week, sometimes 2 weeks in the same month where I got paged at 3 AM or I had to work at sev 2 tickets for the whole night. I lost lot of sleep. I was stressed in a period at the point that I developed idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and I was hospitalized in ICU for 8 days, I had to do coronary angiography and electrophysiological study. Fortunately my arrhythmia disappeared with betablockers and some weeks of rest. After that, I continued to work hard for the company like nothing happened. Never recognized for the efforts I've done so far, never received a promotion in years. I understand people who say it can touch you on a personal level. One day my manager told me that I couldn't get promoted because I'm not ""popular"". Now, I have to leave the company because of return to office (RTO). Do you know what? I'm happy with it.

ga9QadHhbNU,"Manager in Dubai who has been misuing his position and dumping work from his job profile on his subordinate with no compensation.
Nepotism + wasta + “who you know” hiring completely kills morale. You can do everything right—skills, experience, results—and still watch someone leapfrog you because they had a coffee with the right person’s cousin. It makes effort feel pointless, and that’s the most demoralizing part.

Toxic is when the annual extra work comes in, and the 3 pullers have to do half the work of the non-puller.

It’s not about having soft skills, it’s about the actual work. In the toxic culture of ‘everybody can be a leader’ there is no boss. There is a diffusion of responsibility so that everyone can shirk it and blame somebody else. The fucking democracy! Listen. Democracy works ONLY IF you have a team of competent people willing to co-operate. It’s never the case. The teams are like a headless chicken running around in a semi- permanent panic. No wonder no work gets done if there is confusion, no clear scheme of delegation, no clear procedures, and no accountability! Add to that the office politics, and there you have it.

Nevertheless, the warehouse jobs are pretty much stress-free. Granted, they can give you targets on how many pallets to sort and then manipulate your workload so that you have to walk half a mile to find the correct cage/box, but it's generally easy to pull through the shift.

3khYEx0raIM,"I worked at one for Amazon during my early 20s right after graduating college a few years ago. I knew it would take me a while to get a job out of my degree so i started working at the first job i got because i needed money asap. I worked at amazon for a little over a year. I was actually stuck there because i needed to work full time and had to help pay bills and my student loans which were a little under 6k. For a full year, i worked my ass off. Barely bought anything for myself after each paycheck. The job was bad on most days. But the pay was decent for a fresh graduate who was living with his family. I payed off my student loans and credit card debts in less than 6-7 months. Like i didnt even buy any new clothes when i got the job there becasue i focused on paying off my debts and helping out with bills. I also helped mh parents and siblings out with money whenever they needed. All i spent my money on for myself was on gas and food. After i payed off my debts, I saved up a month's worth of money and went on a shopping spree to reward myself. I worked full time for a few months longer and then switched to part time and got a job in accounting from my finance job. Anyone who feels stuck in a job they hate, you have to make some sacrifices for a while such as strictly saving up and then find something you like. Pleaze try to do something that will make you happy because life is just getting harder each day.",Positive

The people that go the distance in warehouses are neurotic workaholics. Just because most don't enjoy the work doesn't mean it's all bad for everyone. Personally, it's not my first choice, but I'd take it over my hours being cut and spending hours twiddling my thumbs. Our civilization rest upon this kind of slavish work. Such is life.

HlR4QB-UxAU,"This reminds me of when I retired 7 years ago. While I was visiting my sick Mother on the East Coast (she passed while I was there), my job (great pay & benefits with a Union) had offered a retirement package to 9 of us older clerical employees. I was working past my retirement age to help my Daughter put my Granddaughter through college. When I got back, my Supervisor called me into her office to tell me she was adding more work to my desk (hated what I was doing). Without hesitation, I told her I was retiring. I hadn't even told HR that I was accepting the package deal.  That was the best thing I could have done for myself. I'm glad I did because later I was diagnosed with cancer (doing good, so far).

They expected us to get back to work😂 yea right. The bathrooms are horrendous and the PAs stalked us while we we're in there. You have to beg them to keep your job if you have -upt.  Sometimes they dont accept your leave of absence. Its crazy you're literally a slave in those warehouses. Its not worth it especially in vegas.

Similar job for 60% to two thirds is reasonable to expect for non union workers but not less than half what we make in most cases with no pension.

Customers and especially the USA are addicted to Amazon and they exploit and abuse the manufacturers, their employees and the local community.

MtX1C7clLjk,"Pretty interesting topic. Thanks for sharing.  

For me money is not the main factor when I choose a job. I mainly want to learn new skills and hopefully use them. I've worked in many companies. Due to the fact, that in my hometown were not super many interesting or cool jobs to pick from, I had to take what I got back then. But after all those years and after I've learned so much I am happy that I can say I can pick and choose that kind of job I like doing. 

For me it is important that I can do or be part of interesting, creative and exciting projects.  And the team should be welcoming and open as well..

Cheers from Austria 🇦🇹",Positive
MtX1C7clLjk,"I currently work at Amazon at one of their fulfillment centers and it’s amazing how some things are the same at an FC as the software development offices such as worry about job security (and people disappearing sometimes), rankings and feelings of competitiveness rather than companionship, and people not being consistently happy with their job there",Positive
MtX1C7clLjk,"If any one sees this. I’m a senior full stack developer in Seattle at another company. The base pay is competitive with Amazon.  Stock not so much but it’s one of the best places I’ve ever worked.  If RSU are awarded is in a normal 4 year split.

MtX1C7clLjk,"Amazon is one of the most wealthy companies in the world, but they nickel and dime their low-end workers, like in the warehouses.  They only upped warehouse worker wages to minimum wage when there was a public outcry.  They don't fulfill their civil and ethical duties to pay all workers a living wage, which they clearly can afford to do. They are the epitome of the corporate greed that is dividing and destroying our country.  They show no appreciation for the people whose backs they depend upon.",Negative
MtX1C7clLjk,"I even didn't watch the video yet, but already knew the answer. Amazon is trying to hire top notch developers paying a very low salary. I was interviewing 5 times at Amazon, but always offered so low salary, so I can't accept an offer. If you are interested in a decent pay, then consider Netflix, they pay really well.",Neutral

MtX1C7clLjk,"I am an SDM at Amazon for 4.5 years now with the same team and everyday I learn something new. The average time for engineers with me is about 3.5 years and the job satisfaction is quite good on the anonymous surveys. I think you got a bit of a bad luck with your team ownership and culture. It's not the same in every org. I do see allot of care and interest in having the engineers engaged, motivated and happy with what they do. Before I joined I did hear some stairs about people crying in their desk, but I have never seen that. We have team events every 2 weeks and an offsite every quarter sponsored by Amazon. But I see you took the right decision, being happy with what you do and have passion for that is what's going to make your time fly. I do agree the benefits are not great, maybe just average but nowhere compared to top companies, but the stock went 4x since I joined, so I can't complaint there.

I routinely meet software engineers aged 30 or younger who say they aren't motivated by compensation, but also say they expect a lot of perks such as free food, pet insurance, etc. etc. Full disclosure, I'm 45 and love free food, but I'd brown bag every day for a $50K raise.

BvxiZXJPdog,Doing business on Amazon is good only for the course sellers and so-called Amazon gurus. There's a possibility that Amazon pays these influencers and gurus to promote doing business on Amazon. This is the easiest way of getting people's money. Amazon charges fees. Gurus charge for their courses. Customers get free kinds of stuff. Amazon stock prices rise by showing high sales volume. And sellers work for all of these for very little.,Positive
BvxiZXJPdog,"You know…you can easily optimize this and make it so you can just work from home.

What you can do instead is get a card that allows you to virtualize. Put it in the customer’s name and have the stuff ship to them directly.

BvxiZXJPdog,"Thank you for the video. That was getting a reality check. I did Amazon a few years ago but stopped doing it after a couple of months because I was restricted on most of the categories and the fees were crazy.

You are very smart and I wish nothing but the best on your future. As an advice from an adult, stay away from drugs, friends who don't respect you or ask for money, be kind to everyone and keep an open mind. Travel the world and interact with other cultures.

They hire everyone off the street and then spit them out like numbers in a system. A lot of people had and I don’t care attitude and made it hard for those who wanted to put in a lot of effort. It felt like a high school atmosphere. Management only came to you when you had “issues“",Positive

umMZYN5jOA0,"- **Amazon's relentless pursuit of perfection**:
  - Compared to Microsoft's earlier years, Amazon is **ruthless** in seeking perfection, focusing on driving constant improvement and achieving market dominance.
  - Amazon has **mastered the art of asking probing questions** and requires answers, pushing for concrete outcomes without allowing business processes to develop without direction.
- **High-pressure work environment**:
  - Working at Amazon is not considered a long-term career for most; **employees typically last around two years** due to the intense demands.
  - **Mistakes are not tolerated**, and repeated errors lead to quick exits, reinforcing a culture where high performance is mandatory.
- **Employee experiences**:
  - Many professionals, even those with long careers at companies like Microsoft, **burn out quickly at Amazon**, feeling exhausted and uninterested in future work after short tenures.
  - While **compensation is good**, the only recognition employees often receive is through pay, with little emphasis on praise or job satisfaction.
- **Contrast with Microsoft**:
  - Microsoft, in contrast, offers a more **relaxed and enjoyable work environment**, with recreational facilities like **foosball tables, gaming machines, and a cricket stadium**, promoting a balanced workplace culture.
  - This congenial atmosphere leads to a **sustainable and less exhausting experience**, differing significantly from Amazon's high-pressure approach.",Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,"In the customer's stance of point of view, this business operation is magnificent. If from higher ups to base level jobs, were given more chances to make mistakes, it would affect millions of customers.

umMZYN5jOA0,"Awful lot of cry babies in this line of work all wanting something for nothing. Why not just go to college and put in the academic work necessary to get an actual career? If you want a job, then don't bother doing anything after high school, or drop out of high school entirely. If you want a career, then stay in school and go on to an actual college or university after. I chose to major in science. Now I'm a full-time laboratory animal researcher that sees more money in one day by conducting phlebotomy and potentially life saving case studies involving animals compared to what anyone sees in a single week shuffeling boxes around. Not only that, but I actually enjoy what I do everyday for how rewarding it is.
But I see this issue coming up a lot with millennials and the so-called ""gen xers"" of our workforce. A lot of you just don't want to bother with the academic work to go any further in life for one reason: LAZINESS. And then you all get pissed off upon realizing the only types of jobs available to you are in brain-dead slave labor roles like warehousing. Well? What else do you expect?... 🤷‍♀️
If you enjoy warehouse work then all the power to you. I'm pointing people who end up in warehousing and just basically want to blame everybody else for being stuck at a job they hate. And yet you're the one that filled out the application. You're the one that went to the orientation (so you knew what you were getting yourself into). And you're the one that walks through the door to hit the time clock. Nobody else put you there. And after working for only a few months, you'll blame management for not treating you nice by giving you a pat on the back or the golden key to the crapper for what you do. You guys even go so far as to blame customers like me that use amazon pretty regularly. And that doesn't make very much sense at all. Why should the customer be put to blame because someone hates their job at amazon ? 
That's no different than going into a McDonald's and being treated like crap by the person at the cash register because they're unhappy with their ""McJob."" And all you did was ask for a coffee. Fair? (Not at all).
Remember, CUSTOMERS are the baseline for every business, and also the main reason why anyone serving in retail gets a paycheck in the first place. And that's better than nothing. Amazon workers need to do their job so I can do mine. My role relies on having readily available access to things like syringes, vials, microscope slides and pet food on a very consistent basis. If you don't like what you're doing then quit and enroll in some classes to get an actual career. You can walk right out the same door you walked in through at any time.

I almost convinced myself to try getting a job there again as they say they've changed now, and promise work-life balance. Apparently not. What I cannot reconcile is my ex-colleague, who is a reasonable human being, apparently has worked there for maybe 4-5 years. Modesty doesn't let me ask him out of the blue how come he is still there. Another example is a person who interviewed me more than 10 years ago is apparently also there. He seemed reasonable, although he told me he never takes vacations. When I heard my jaw drop, he explained why take a vacation if you know it will be ruined.",Positive

You are pushed, manipulated and are being tracked in every step you take. I chose my family above Amazon and i would anytime of the day because in the end Amazon is a narcissistic company.
The once cute Jeff Bezos with his low standards is not there anymore. I was so happy when i got my contract but once i finished training after 4 weeks i knew what kind of environment it was. 
Enter the company and you need to learng everything about Amazon from 1995 till now. 
Then you will get ''coffee talks'' the moments where everybody reads their script and you are stuck there at the end of the day listening to some butchered HR people or how they made it to lvl 5 in 3 years time ( by killing a lot of their co-workers i bet)
It's a '' i will be succesfull as long as my competition can be killed.  If it wasn't every manage over there wouldn't look +20 years older then their actual age xD.
Even if you give it your all, you won't make it. THey will keep squeezing and squeezing until you pop. A permanent contract makes it even worse. You will get 3 offers if you fail to follow their standards:

1. 5k + immediately quit and no harm will be done.
or
2. You will follow an intense course to not ever repeat your mistake( so intense 95% leaves in the course and 5% will leave after the course because the company will keep pressuring you for your past mistake.
or
3. You are free to sue us but be warned. 

How about them apples? 
And yes try reaching out to them you will see how hight the retardness-level scales from 1-100 i bet they make it a 1000. 

I know the inside vision of Amazon and how to dry out sellers, it's ridicoulous and they keep on threatening people when you leave the company  you will be sued for ill speaking of Amazon...imagine.

I did nothing wrong, I did what the fuck I was told and I told ethics to look into it and they just brushed it off like whatever but I take medicine I needed accomodations in work and they refused me that. I wanted to file a lawsuit. Like for real.",Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,If they continue in this way employees will no more be loyal to the company,Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,Of course amazon is ruthless because they can be everything is done behind closed walls.  It doesn't affect there bottom line one little bit and they know it.  If you work at amazon they consider it a MAJOR privilege .  That is why the working conditions are so brutal,Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,"@Valuetainment this video was an excellent interview about amazon's culture. it's one thing to hear or read things, another to get a direct insight from a reliable source.
cheers from southern ontario 🍁",Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,"At my site, the 20 year block is blank. No one lasts that long except Jeff. I work in HR and it’s high pressure.",Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,"Amazon is a garbage company who lies and tricks people to get their way. Their cunning, despicable mentality of delivering the package much, much later than expected probes that they must get their way. That price of human garbage Jeff Bazos needs more money for his swimming pool while his poor, innocent customers don’t get their package as they were so foolishly promised and his workers can barely afford a glass of water to keep them arrive. If you have something important you’ve been expecting or anticipating, do yourself a favor by NOT ordering from Amazon, unless you looks high prices for late packages. I made that mistake and it’ll be one that makes me more wise than I was before.",Neutral
umMZYN5jOA0,"I lived next the Seattle Amazon campus for years. I met my share of burnt out employees. What a turd of a company Amazon. The employees didn't even really have time to say hello, they were drones. When you work at Amazon, you become a terrible neighbor, and overall depressed person.",Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,"Patrick is practically ejaculating on himself,  hearing how tough and Harsh Amazon's work culture is.",Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,"We created a monster with Amazon.  Well I am glad to say I have not used the site regardless of how crazy that may seem to most.  I remember when the small hardware stores in Philly were selling out before Home Depot or Walmart arrived and at a young age I understood the good and bad that was to come.  Personally I have no problem paying more for an item from a local business and I do not need everything in my hands yesterday.  We have all become addicts to convenience and it is all changing going into 2021.  Jeff Bezos (Not his initial last name) wants to control all retail aspects across the board to implement a system that will be based on a minute to minute supply/demand algorithm.  Parts for a 20 year old truck will no longer be affordable, trending will take on a whole new meaning, and worst of all he will eventually control thoughts and impulses should a neurolink become a mainstream item.  I give him credit as a businessman with unheard of drive but the story he tells does not hold water for me.  I believe he and most figureheads of big tech companies are in someway knowing or unknowingly acting on behalf of DARPA and/or a certain 3 letter agency to play the roll while being am innovator yet taking direction from handlers playing the world game of chess.  It's all about power and if you follow the money or better yet the data, you will find the wizard behind the curtain.  Mr. Bezo's ""leaked"" text messages to his girlfriend seemed more along the lines of amateur, even laughable and desperate for a guy worth $100's of Billions.  He most likely had to be put in his place and a honeytrap or simply a news headline picked up by the Sun or TMZ type of media falls in line with a 3 letter agency that literally goes about it's business with an unlimited budget and no oversight.  The new oil is data and since that agency acts as the global leading cartel, my money is on them controlling all we the people helped them create in record time.  Amazon is a blood sucking, soulless company that I can not see any one happily working for in general.  Two years would be like aging 10 years.  Look at their hiring and treatment in fulfillment centers and let's not even mention their trucks and drivers being hammered to the point they do not care about the vehicle or blocking a main street in a big city.  I wish you all the best in the future and hope we can all come together as a species otherwise we will tear each other apart in some way or another.  Maybe it's too late...All I know is that I will not take part in their reset and new normal...I do not fear the only guarantee in life after we are born.  There is much more energy and consciousness that my soul and all souls will experience after judging oneself following physical death...Gotta be truthful and real in the end.  Bezo's thinks of himself as a god that will live forever...Sounds more like a demon to me since we are living in hell on earth going into the year 2021 or whatever year it is or isn't.",Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,There are 99% negative messages about Amazon ...Why they are not in bankruptcy? Why people still go to work for Amazon?,Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,"There's always Amazon warehouse jobs constantly listed on job boards, but I know to stay away from Amazon, no matter what.",Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,Who works at Amazon and accepts to be treated like that other than Asians and Indians?,Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,"Amazon is a fast paced environment that a lot of people can’t keep up. There’s no shame in it tho, working for a company like that isn’t for everyone.",Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,Working at amazon is the 7th ring of hell.,Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,Can Bezos do his warehouse Jobs or Delivery Jobs?  Put him to work there for a month.,Neutral
umMZYN5jOA0,"This is how most big business works.  Leave nothing to uncertainty and where there is uncertainty, minimise the risk to timelines and goals.",Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,I worked at Amazon warehouse the turn over rate was 80% after 3 months that should tell you something,Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,"1.  I am glad they push for perfection, why do anything if you are not trying to be the best.  (as a consumer I love their service and it is probably because they are striving to be perfect).

2.  No one is working at a company for 15 to 20 years anymore the average tech company retention is probably 1.5 years at best.",Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,"As a senior level management in tech, everyone around me sees working for Amazon / Lab126 as an absolute joke, myself included. Not only do they demand your life and your first born child, they don't even pay competitively (verified through their recruiters). I see working for them as an absolute last resort when you're hurting and literally no other companies would take you.",Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,Says nothing about any of the delivery guys it's all about the head office. Very narrow minded video.,Neutral
umMZYN5jOA0,"I’ve never worked at Amazon but I currently work for a company who used to be a vendor for Amazon and I used to be the person in charge of looking after purchase orders, ASN’s, and shipping discrepancies. We eventually had to pull out due to their insanely high expectations. They have very strict shipment windows that leave no wiggle room for back orders, they need every box to be packaged a certain way which takes more man hours than normal, they constantly try to dictate how you sell your products (pkg quantities), how much you sell your products for, and should you fail to meet their requirements at any of the above, you get charged an infraction fee. I was so relieved when my company decided to cut the cord. To them, most companies are just a drop in the bucket. It was a huge pain in the ass to cut ties with them too.
From a buyers standpoint, they’re great. Be careful when becoming a seller though. Things get tougher as the volume grows.",Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,Great for customers but horrible for employees,Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,i worked at amazon warehouse for 2 days.. the work is easy and not bad but the leadership and management is horrible.. lots of micromanaging and bad leadership of immature people.. if the leadership was better it would be a great place to work..,Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,They treat their workers without mercy and pay no taxes. Any company could make lots of money if they were given the permission to do that.,Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,People leave Microsoft and go to Amazon -  and then go back to Microsoft about 9 months later.   Bezos kicked his first wife to the curb like she was an employee and got another bimbo.,Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,"I want something, I use Prime, and boom, 2 days later I have it, free shipping.  Returns are prepaid, and a breeze. Prime also gets me tons of great video content. For me as a consumer, Amazon does everything I need it to.  No one is forcing anyone to work there.",Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,I worked at amazon this summer and it was absolutely  brutal let me tell ya...,Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,Thank God I work for a good warehouse,Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,"Walmart Warehouse does the same thing.  They have a 'vested system, but I don't know ANYONE who's ever reached it.

As soon as you get close, i.e 3 years. They start changing your shift every week and changing your responsibilities until you're late or make mistakes.

Then you're fired and you can reapply in a few years, or you can transfer to a store where you make a fraction of what you used to make.",Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,"Warehousing employs much of the lower class. A lot of warehouse jobs are moving to these temp, low pay long work hours, pick X amount or be fired. They use staffing agencies to constantly bring in fresh meat. Glad to be getting out of it",Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,"Unfortunate. These giant companies should be the BEST places to work at, setting the standard and providing the best working experience for their employees. I guess somewhere along the line employee loyalty is just forgotten about..",Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,"Amazons problem is the problem the becomes inevitable- inefficiencies of scale. The larger you get, the more inefficient and unstable you become. The less cohesive the organization becomes. When you have that many employees, some degree of corruption becomes inevitable by pure statistics, and disorganization also becomes inevitable to a certain degree. It’s why massive companies typically don’t grow into infinity, and why massive organizations are typically taken down by smaller innovative start ups. In ‘08 the government called several banks and companies “too big to fail”. They got it backwards. They were too big not to fail.",Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,"My experience is through their service when things go wrong, you have to really escalate things for them to get things right, so i don't agree with this video at all.... It maybe a pressure cooker in the office .but Amazon you need to ask this question again? Does your environment really translate into an experience you are proud of when things go wrong for your customers? Well for me that hmmm is a nope definitely not at first point of contact anyway....",Negative
umMZYN5jOA0,"Im quittin my amazon account now, I've known this truth for a long time, now this video is the tipping point for me.
I hope alternate.com isnt that way",Positive
umMZYN5jOA0,But peoples continues to work for them making this guy becoming 1st trillionaires so who's the mug🤷‍♂️,Neutral
umMZYN5jOA0,This sounds like a very poisonous professional environment !!!!!!!!! I respect Mr Bezos and his right to do whatever he pleases with his company but it's a hell of a way to treat your employees when your going through them 10 a time !!!!!!!,Negative
